A3UXW18DP4WSD6_B003VWKPHC,"Love it Like it better than the other tuner I bought, this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again."
A1JN3UIUZAHF7V_B0002H03YY,"Great set of strings for super strat guitars! I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George, I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
A1RSRUQVKB5EBO_B0002IHP0S,"seems nice I haven't used this yet, but it seems solid and idiot proof - just like I need. Play coffee shops and will help if I drop my pick. Very good price."
A2JRFV125VJ71R_B0002GLCRC,Just fine Shipped in time. Just what I have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to screw it on the wall.
A1SCWHXAB2ZK7N_B0002E1G5C,"Good Works just fine. Except the little knob that's supposed to take out the parts that hold in the strings (the little pins or whatever) it doesn't grip onto mine (I have an acoustic jasmine takkamine) so I had to get out pliers from my toolbox, but that's okay. One size doesn't always fit all. Good price."
A1YP96MT6W9FTB_B0002E3B78,"Excellent Value, Look, and Sound I've owned a Seymour Duncan Woody for several months now, and have had a chance to try it out with various amps, with the pickup tipped for a stronger low end or high end, and so on.  This is an excellent value and is basically as feedback free as you're likely to get from an acoustic guitar pickup.  The one thing I've found is that I get a significantly more natural acoustic guitar sound playing the Woody through my Ampeg bass amp than through my Peavey guitar amp.  The high ends are too grating through an electric guitar amp and there's a tendency for distortion to creep in, even with the clean setting.  Through the bass amp, though, the tone is absolutely clean and clear.  The pickup is easy enough to install and remove and it's easy to get it to sit low enough that it doesn't interfere with finger picking any more than any other sound hole pickup would.  The other great feature of this pickup is the look; the natural wood finish actually enhances the look of the guitar.  If you are looking for an acoustic guitar pickup, this is the one to buy!"
ALHC64J88LVWO_B000EEL6J6,"It's D'Addario I've played guitar for some 35 years and have found D'Addario strings to be of consistently good quality.  They are one of maybe three companies I trust to manufacture a good set of strings no matter what classification of instrument.  Whether classical (nylon), acoustic (brass) or electric (nickel)... their strings produce excellent sound and are durable.Like any string, one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style.  That comes through reading reviews and quite often, simply testing.  But I've never played a set of this brand that I didn't like.  They always provide vibrant tonal quality.And no I don't work for D'Addario; just a long-time fan. : )"
A3TN5X62JAXGFB_B003SZDFM4,"OK for small or cheap guitars. Not good for high-end guitars. - Put this on a Gibson J-45. It did increase the bass (OK, as that's not a J-45's strength) but it ruined the wonderful clarity and balance these guitars have. Also took off a little of the finish on the sound-hole when I removed it.- Tried it on a Martin D-28. Nope. The bass got muddier, which is definitely the *wrong* way to go with a Martin.- At this point, was going to return it, but finally tried it on a small body. Now THIS worked GREAT. Louder, focused and projects much better - almost resonator-like. Fantastic for slide or capo'd high. That's it's home now.So...An O-Port can help a guitar that needs help - a small body or cheap guitar. In my sample of 2, it made high-end guitars sound worse. If you can't afford a better guitar, may be worth a try. But, be careful, as it did chip off some finish on at sound-hole."
A1CD7IUM2JRPY1_B0002CZVA0,"Still the best. I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market, this pedal still sells well. Not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which I'm happy with.I've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain, I punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost, I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow."
A1YAR5PTXNRA7X_B0002E3DNK,"Just what I needed I've bought 4 of these over the past couple of years.  I wanted a stand that is pretty solid but also had a clamp to hold the guitar that I could use one handed.  It gives me piece of mind that somone won't just brush up against a guitar and damage it.  I've noticed that it has been backordered on several sites, so I expect that there are a lot of other people who really like it too."
A1BZHWOFQ9W3BP_B004UJO41S,what a deal I bought this for the other half of my duet to use on there guitar and mandolin .They had there doubts about how good it would sound and if it would feedback.Well surprise surprise surprise it didn't feedback and it sounds great.I would recommend this product.
A3CSSZ6U5J4YS5_B001PGXKC8,"Great cables No cable noise, works well with pedals that don't play nice with other right-angle plugs (like the original line of Aguilar pedals). Great little product, and I would buy them again."
AEHDGUE3L90ZS_B005ZV5K0O,"It is what it is Like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa. I also have a dog with a nasty habit of having to &#34;mark&#34; everything that comes into contact with the floor. So needless to say your basic guitar stand was not an option with my $700 Dean from Hell. I had ordered this product prior to my having gotten the guitar (hoping that they would all arrive at the same time) so I was unaware at how heavy the Dean was. This one looked sturdy enough...and it would be, if it were an acoustic or lightweight/hollowbody electric.But the fact that I had to bend out the pegs just a smidge, so the end knobs won't chew up the neck when trying to access/store the guitar, had me doubting the longterm durability of this product. Don't need to come home 6 months from now & find the guitar on the floor with the headstock accross the room. It should hold up long enough for me to order the Hercules. Once I get the Hercules I'll be using this mount for my Rock Band guitar controller."
A1U3T27RHRIDYN_B0002E1G5C,"excellent everything you need to make replacing strings nice and easy, add a headstand to hold the headstock up and you are set"
AUUI1FKERRMV2_B000CBXZXG,Great for a Quick Polish Will this replace a pro fret job? Nah...That said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth.End results[...]
AKHWZ3S1UVZAO_B000P5LVSK,"Nice Picks Nice picks.  A bit small for my preference.  Great for picking, kind of harsh for strumming,  Quality seems top-notch.  Some guitarists will love these."
A1ZMV5QSAR8V2L_B0033PSGSW,"poly tune Cool tuner, I have this on my pedal board and it works really well, very easy to seeand is true bypass which is nice when it isn't on...."
A1M3XD9UV3PD3I_B000EEL8US,Excellent Guitar Picks These are excellent guitar picks.  They don't slip in my fingers like the Eddie Van Halen guitar picks I purchased a while back.
A3ABAA36CZVYNX_B000KIPT30,"Indispensable I hooked this up to the output of my Mackie mixing desk. I have my powered monitors (via a Y cable) on one output and my headphones on another.I can now play my guitar, write, record, etc through the speakers or the headphones and very quickly switch between them without messing about with cables and whatnot.Because my headphones are closed (DJ type) they cut out a lot of background noise and I previously found myself wondering ""are the speakers off?"". It was particularly awkward in that the power switches for my speakers is on the back. Not handy!Now I've installed this headphone amp it's definitely become an integral part of my setup, and definitely worth the money. Now I can actually get on with the music :-)Another excellent Behringer purchase. Recommended without hesitation."
A28DVY0Q6PPO1J_B0002D0CEO,awesome my favorite picks. Can't go wrong with tortex. the only habit I have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so I have to buy like a ton of them
A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN_B007Q28BHE,"Five stars for doing what it does at this price point This is my 6th Joyo pedal and like the others, it does not dissapoint.  I think these and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the best bang for your buck in pedals these days.  Like many have mentioned, this pedal is like a TS but without the mid-hump.  This pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture.  When you run it into a cleanish tube amp and you dig it, it breaks up.  When you play lightly, it gets cleaner- which is why it is so similar to the $200 Sweet Honey pedal (the controls are also identical but I haven't compared the internals).  That touch sensitivity is lost IMHO if you stack this with another dirt box or if you are running it into an amp that is already raging with gain.  When you do that, it acts more like a traditional OD would- which is totally cool, but you are losing the touch sensitivity thing that sets this pedal apart.  If I could only bring one dirt box to the gig it would probably be something more mid-gain (like the Joyo Ultimate Drive or the Dano Transparent OD)  but if you are in the market for a sweet honey pedal and don't have that kind of bankroll, you should definately check this out-Edit:  Having owned this pedal for a while, I realize I was incorrect in saying you lose touch sensitivity running into another dirtbox.  This pedal actually plays well with mid-gain types of overdrives like the Joyo Ultimate Drive, the OCD, or the Dano Drive.  When you dig in, you CAN get more breakup so long as the other overdrive isn't dimed.  This pedal has become an essential, 'always on' pedal for me !"
A2W8RH6YUNXH83_B003VWJ2K8,"Snark works awesome! What can I say....for the price, this is the best tuner out there right now!  So nice not having to step on a tuning pedal in order to tune while I'm gigging onstage.  I just cut the volume on my guitar (Snark senses vibrations through the neck...so no sound needed!) and I'm done!Tap tempo works great too if you need to know the tempo of a song!  Just another awesome bonus :)"
A12N7TJQR2RB9W_B002GHBZ4U,"Bugera V5 5-Watt Guitar Amp This is a great little amp especially for the money. It's all tube, has a power attenuator, headphone out and reverb all for under $200 - CRAZY!! It's built extremely well and has some weight to it, but you'd have no problem carrying it to a small gig. A 5 watt tube amp is still quite LOUD, so the attenuator is a god-send.How does it sound you ask? Tone is subjective, but to my ears it can get quite ""Marshally"" without a lot of work with a Les Paul as well as a Tele. I don't own a Strat, so I can't comment on single coils through it. On the 1 watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about 5 I had a damn good ""Back In Black"" style hard rock tone. If you want to play Metal you're going to need a distortion/overdrive pedal. I've found that if you pin the gain it can get a bit boxy and fizzy. The headphone out isn't great, it's good enough for practice, but don't try to use it as a line out for recording.I've done some recording using a 57 on-axis about an inch from the speaker grill slightly right of center. When stacking 3-4 tracks (especially using different guitars) I got a HUGE, Plexi like tone without it getting muddy or fuzzy.I haven't swapped tubes or the speaker - it's completely stock. I might try putting a Jensen speaker in it, but the stock tone is just fine as it is. The stock speaker is an 8"" Bugera ""vintage"" (think greenback clone) and it is darker than a lot of small speakers. A lot of guys are swapping out the tubes for JJ's or GT's, but it all depends on what you're after for tone.A lot of guitar snobs are afraid of the Beringer name on it (Bugera is made by Beringer), but I found this amp to be very good quality - especially given that it was made in China.I would recommend this amp if you are looking for good tube tone on the cheap. It's an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type. I was able to get great Marshall like tone out of it quite easily. Good stuff!!"
A2IC4MEKF2Y6IF_B003VWJ2K8,"The best! I love this little guy. Clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you, it will still accurately tune the guitar. Very easy and simple to use. I paid $9 for it and it is 10 times better than the $40 one I have."
A9RAHOMYAQB51_B000RKVH0K,For the money this really delivers I was very skeptical about this mic being so cheap and all but I use it in my band with several other Shure mics and I cant tell the difference the same pa mix and they sound the same..I plan on getting a few more of these.
A1TLMSOE1VRDZI_B0073XCXHA,I keep buying more of these - 12 guitars and 1 Bass. I want one for each of them Let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide. the batterry that come with it lasts an average of 6 -9 months - A new battery will last over a year - I get replacements at local CVS - Savon store
A2D0F87RY5YMHN_B0002E3CHC,Top of the line Strings D'Addario guitar strings are favourite strings.  They last a little longer and always sound good on my Ovation guitars and also or my other acoustic guitars.  I usually buy them for and recommend them to others also.  You can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often.  You will notice a longer life and your guitar will certainly remained tuned.
A46D3MTB5LIUY_B0007GGUGA,"PRICELESS !!!  My ""Capo Quest"" is over !!! As musicians, sometimes we find just the right sound or feel with a piece of equipment and it changes everything taking our performance to a new level.  For me it happened when I found just the right sound & feel from my Taylor acoustic guitar, the right vocal mics, the right mixer, my Bose L1 Model II, etc.Today I had one of those finds. After years of being somewhat dissatisfied with every capo I've encountered I discovered the perfect capo for me: the G7th Performance Capo.  I'm not kidding - it was one of those finds.  As an acoustic guitar player / vocalist, obviously, I have to play all of my songs in the right key for an optimum vocal performance.  This means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shape/structure.  Unfortunately, some of my songs had ""weak"" spots (sending them to my ""B"" list) courtesy of the combination of a ""weaker"" chord for me (due to physical limitations) & the reduced sustain & tonal quality resulting from using a capo.  This dissatisfaction has had me on a ""capo quest"" which ended today when I found the G7th Performance Capo.The first thing I noticed when I used the G7th was the improved sustain over every other capo I've used.  All of those ""weak"" spots in my songs totally disappeared.  I quickly dusted off several songs that were on my ""B"" list & found the improved sustain & tonal quality allowed me to move them to my ""A"" list.I have no problem with the weight of this capo (others have pointed out that it is heavier) I can't detect any change in balance when handling my guitar (I play sitting on a guitar stool with the guitar resting on my leg - perhaps someone standing using a guitar strap might notice a slight difference in the balance.)  I love the ""self-ratcheting"" feature of the G7th.  I thought from some reviews & videos I watched that I'd have to pinch-down on the open end fairly firmly for a secure hold - this was NOT the case.  I think the G7th has just the right width & density of foam under the top bar:  a) providing more ""friction"" to hold this capo in place;  b) playing a role in very effectively dampening the strings; & c) possibly being more gentle on the strings than a more narrow/harder foam or rubber top bar, thus having less impact on tuning.I did find one slight negative about this capo which I was able to quickly overcome.  The end of the top metal bar (on the open end of capo) is slightly more ""squared-off"" than the end of the bottom piece (which in contrast is rounded off).  It may be just the way I play some chords, but my hand was contacting that squared-off end of the top bar & was getting irritated - so I simply turned the capo around with the open end facing me (versus facing the floor) & the surfaces contacting my hand were far smoother - thus, zero  irritation.  This was nothing new to me - I have had to do this with other capos.Others have commented on the cost of this capo.  For me, the cost of this capo was nothing compared to the many thousands of dollars I've spent finding just the right guitars, PA's, mics, & other equipment / accessories.  I almost can't believe it only cost me $40 to make such a difference in my sound. The G7th Performance Capo is priceless !!!Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this capo - if you're like me - this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level !!!  I'm a strong believer in having back-ups for critical components so I will immediately purchase another G7th as a back-up (maybe I'll order the black or gold & use my silver one as the back-up)."
A3PGQWCSJPCYDH_B000B6FBA2,"Just ok You have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this. What a pain. Oh well, it was cheap enough to have around."
A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y_B0002CZUUG,"Five stars for value and playability I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season - I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrong.My expectations were frankly low. I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)I am not wild about the strings that came stock, but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums. I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads. In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withD'Addario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Light, 12-52, which, while thick, should make the instrument jazz-friendly. I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation, but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me, the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box, though, the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed. I have already invested in a good - but not great case:Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar (I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits.)For the record, I use the following amp, which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar:Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom  The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head.Bottom line: this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players. The price is right, and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year."
A3EA7KGYC8LB0_B00AZUAORE,"Best Loop Pedal This is the most awesome loop pedal ever!!! does the trick perfect, you can remove and add in elements to your loop! super small, only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered."
A3GAP455S8YH0M_B0018TIADQ,"Guitar Stand I was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only 10 bucks but glad I did.This stand is VERY sturdy, well made & durable.Foam padded everywhere guitar touches!! Can be folded for easy transport!! Rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard!!Pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand!!Highly recommended, very happy with purchase!!Joe"
A27KQGXAU8Z7OT_B002QJVTNA,Don't know. I didn't use this a lot because it was a little uncomfortable. But is a well made product if you use it for what it's for.
A24JW33E1DW64K_B004FPEF84,"Pretty decent product This was a precent decent product, I was able to use it to clean the strings on all my guitars and it worked well but the cloth that comes with it was really cheap so when you wipe down the strings, it starts to break down and leave a lot of lint behind and pieces of it get caught in the strings and frets.  Otherwise, besides that, the cleaner itself is great.  I just have to use another cloth to wipe it down afterwards and pick off the lint that gets caught in the strings and frets."
AM870TTAD2RFT_B000PAPO9W,"For garageband on imac I was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband.This product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the 1/4&#34; port (the product specs does not show or say 1/4 plug port).My product has an orange USB light instead of a blue one. The support people at Behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo (sounds like BS to me).The problem I had and the reason I bought this is that I tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a 1/4-1/8 adapter chord. It works but the levels are too low. When I received this, I was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are, but not by much. It is a step up from the adapter, but far from professional. I'd say the level is beginner/intro level sound and quality.I bought a &#34;like new&#34; product describing faded or damaged packaging. When it arrived, the pkg box was dented (I don't care) and product looked new inside. But, all the instructions described a blue USB light and CD of driver and recording software which this did not come with. Behringer gave me a link to download. I assure you it's crapware and beware. For the mac, garageband is far better and easier to use.Rock out!"
A3OEBPVLF35YQL_B005M0TKL8,This would be a must-have at twice the price. nan
ASYHYW0USZVN6_B0018TIADQ,Very useful Its very useful. Looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand. very durable as well.
A1DVUFG2QSJ6IK_B005FKF1PY,"Great little tuner I have bought several small tuners through the years, but this one has become a favorite. It is Tiny, but the screen is well lit and quite legible. It fits the headstock by pressing the ratcheted clip and releases by a small button on the front. There is a metronome function, which I haven't used. Simply strike a string. If it is out of tune you get a red light with flat or sharp bars. When the key is in tune, you will see a green indicator light and 1 bar on each side. I don't know how dependable and how long it will last since I have only had the two for about a month."
AAON97IT5IHP2_B0002H0A3S,"Grass is GOOD ! D'Addario ALWAYS puts out a nice product.  The E and B strings never have enough coating, but still.  In comparison to others, they do a good job of getting the music out there in a bright and sustained manner."
A3PGQWCSJPCYDH_B003B01QR2,Have been using these ever since first try I decided to try these because the &#34;normal&#34; picks I was using kept slipping out of my fingers. That was several months ago. I am still using these everyday. Pretty durable and reliable. I do recommend these.
A2XSWF2AJSXQZB_B000978D58,Great value for the money but not perfect. This stand surprised my. It is lightweight but is still sturdy. I wouldn't venture to use it on the road all the time. But as a backup stand I wouldn't hesitate. I like it much better than my musicians gear stand though if this had a double extendable boon it would be perfect.
A2074KEJGRYJV4_B00BHK2UHI,Good Cord A friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord. LOL The cord delivers good sound quality. The only problem I have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy.
A3CNFMV0IISC3C_B000T9PE9E,Awseome Buy this. It's cheap and better than Fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much. It can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard.....Amazing sounds!
A10ZSXTQA264C7_B0002D0JZ6,"It's so funky I can smell it!! Holy guacamole, you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase, then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too."
A2XVE2J5WGCSGX_B001R2LQWQ,"You Can Rely On BOSS As an ""Old School"" Guitarist introducing new gear into my rig always makes me nervous. With a somewhat massive pedal board filled with individual Boss pedals which is often too large for some of the venues my band gigs at & definitely too large for our practice studio (and a bit too heavy to lug around).I researched every multi-effect unit on the market today & decided the ME-70 was the best way to go for me mainly for the ""Manual"" settings. When I received the unit, it came out of the box ready to go (other than installing batteries) and worked exactly like I had my ""rig"" shrunk down into a rugged small package.COSM- With the amp simulation & Pre-Amp portion I don't need to carry an amplifier any longer because this unit has the ability to clone my coveted tube amp collection with the twist of a knob.Effects- Boss is ""THE BOSS"" of effect pedals in my opinion... this unit combines everything I need & then some in a single unit with the ability of individual tweaking. I do not venture into the unit's ability to remember settings because every venue I gig at has different acoustics & constant tweaking is required to achieved the tones I want to hear."
A2N7F3MVCTAOYP_B0002E3MRW,"BEWARE:!!! It's not a hard plastic Mic Clip it's Rubber Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says ""Heavy Duty"" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead."
A2CJVLER896Q7L_B0016ZZKJO,"MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay - Great pedal! This is a great effect. I am very happy with it. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. This delay device is (on my humble opinion) probably the best delay out there. It is very sensitive and delivers as it should, with a delay rate from 0 to 600 miliseconds. Most units offer a max of around the 400 mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards. This pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver. I am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations. Ships fast. Highly recommended."
A120FZ2ESIMA63_B00BU9KCXK,Great buy! It has a nice solid construction and a sturdy stance. Yet it folds flat to provide storage capability in a minimum of space.
A204ETWOV23HO4_B003LTJ404,"Good sturdy stands, but not as wide as I'd like, and a pain to adjust This is definitely a sturdy and well made stand - I have no fault with it about that. Solid materials, everything snaps and latches tightly. Good materials. Works just like it's supposed to.I have two complaints about it, though.1. The part that holds the music isn't as wide as other stands. I probably could have read the description and realized that, but I made the assumption that all stands are the same size. It's just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper. It will hold bigger things, of course, but the edges will go past the edge of the stand. So it works, but to me, it looks unprofessional to have the stuff leaking over the edges. The ledge is nice and wide, though, so it can hold some pretty thick stuff. But if you are using quite wide materials, especially if they are loose-leaf, you will want to look for a wider stand.2. Adjusting the height and tilt is difficult. To alter the height, one has to twist and untwist the tightening ring (like one finds on microphone stands). It doesn't just pull up or push down like the majority of music stands I've encountered in life. Adjusting the tilt requires untightening and tightening a wing nut on the back, which is a bit difficult to reach. Unlike every other music stand I've used that one can simply force into position. The good news of this is, though, that because everything is held in place with wingnuts or that tightening ring, everything stays right where one puts it. No slow sliding down in height, no slow tilting backwards.On the plus side, they are sturdy, and the feet can be retracted (is that the word?) so that they are parallel to the stand, making moving them around or stacking them up quite easy. I love the fact that the feet do this.These are excellent music stands."
A1YTMYDNMTQXLE_B000UF3SEA,"Not as bad as I was expecting I purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim. I was looking at some nicer ones, and decided to give it a go for only $20. It came in the mail today, and i was surprised that basic-ness of the packaging. Very little instructions at all actually.This DOES NOT ship with a 9 volt battery, and putting one in yourself is kind of a pain to change, as you have to get a philips screwdriver and unscrew 4 corner screws on the back to do so. (wish there was a plastic back, or thumb screw option)This pedal is really quiet, and not in a good way.Don't expect to boost your signal level with it, with the makeup gain/output knob all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down, it was about the same volume as the original signal, only a little noisier.Did not seem to be a tone sucker in the chain/add any noise when off. Most compressors add a little noise or hiss when on, due to the nature of raising the noise floor.It also has a SUBSTANTIAL treble boost/low cut going on. even with the sensitivity knob all the way down, it kills your low end. It is quite bright sounding.With that being said, it works wonders on single string/double stop stuff on the already trebley stuff played on the G, B, and E strings, and makes them sound tight and full.It does seem quite durable, The case isn't made of cheap plastic, which is a good thing.Though not as rugged as some of the other pedals I would own.The switch and inputs seem a little cheap though, granted it was a $20 pedal.I feel using this pedal on tour might be a bad idea, however for home/non daily-use i could see it lasting a while.The LED is really bright. Almost so bright, that when you're looking to adjust the controls, it makes it somewhat hard to see what you're doing.All in all, if you're looking for a cheap compressor to boost your  treble strings and give em some extra punch, this may be the pedal for you, especially if you only have $20.If you're looking for a warm full bodied compressor, this is not the choice for you. You should really wait and get the MXR Dyna Comp for just a few bucks more."
A1MI9FDCNB3CMR_B0000AQRST,"Industry Standard Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech, the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best."

A34O0KQV4QXWNQ_B0037ME50Y,"Perfect For Connecting A Segment Of Pedals On A Pedaltrain 2 I ended up ordering this cable to connect my bottom row of effects to my top row, on a Pedaltrain 2 board. It's the perfect length, and the very slight bit of excess can be zip-tied against the Pedaltrain, leaving a total stealth install. Since then, I've ordered these patch cable in other lengths, and they've done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard."
A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H_B0009K9MUA,"Awesome, awesome guitar hanger This is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people. Great for people with babies/toddlers looking to get their guitars off the ground like myself.I love the unique self-locking mechanism that it has. The weight of the guitar lowers the hanger and moves the lock levers up so your guitar neck is securely fastened. I have an electric and an acoustic hanging up. The acousitc's body is about 4.5"" thick and has plenty of clearance from the wall when hung. The electric I think weights around 8 pounds and it held no problem by the Hercules hook. I believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs.I only installed into studs and wouldn't really want to try a drywall-only installation. The product does come with drywall anchors but many of the reviewers said the included drywall anchors are cheap and not that good. The wood screws that came with the product I found to be a little short (if you were installing on dry-wall in front of a stud). Others found this to be true too. I bought #8 Wood Screws in 2.5"" length at the hardware store and these worked perfectly for my install. The included screws I  think are about 2"" in length or a little less."

This is the last one you will ever need to buy."
AMP0Z3DR4RCH7_B000JRPYGE,"Awesome Mic for a Great Price I'm pretty new to using mics and PA systems but have used dynamic mics in the past, recreationally.  This condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic, I was surprised when I took it out of the box.  It is as good looking in person as in the pictures.  Three things for the benefit of other newbs: 1.) I learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you're going to use this for vocals, since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it. 2.) This has a cardioid pickup pattern; you don't sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic.  This should stand straight up on a mic stand, paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it. 3.) It requires phantom power.  You need a PA that provides 48V power to use it.When I first used this mic, I tried singing into the end of it and couldn't hear myself very well.  Later in the evening I was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that I had to back away about a foot from the mic.  Then I remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand, paying attention to the orientation of the mic.  It was so sensitive that I really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals.  I have a Rainsong WS1100 acoustic electric guitar I was playing, and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly.  Other musicians were impressed by it as well.  I payed just under a $100 for it, which I think is a great value for this product."
A1NAA1R38JSNHV_B001E3SFKO,"Works wonders Pop filters already work great to block out wind and other unwanted noises from a microphone. And this with that extra filter on it, it blocks even more. It's simply amazing. Worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter. If I want I can blow directly into the filters and it'll block all wind from the microphone and will only pick up soundwaves."
A37WW789WSY81F_B0008G26JO,"Truly a ""SMOKIN"" speaker! The Eminence Patriot Cannabis Rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker I've ever heard.  Period.This does not mean that it's dull sounding or muffled at least, not if you hearing is still good.  I hesitated quite a bit before I decided to buy it and install it in my Fender Mustang II but my worries were for naught. Incredibly, it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds.  Yet, for overdrive sounds, there is very little fuzziness - just a big full and FAT sound that's articulate without being buzzy.  If you play metal you'll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy, classic rock and jazzy sounds, this is a speaker to seriously consider.  I turned my Mustang II into an open back combo and the Cannabis Rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed.  I had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps, it never got shrill or piercing, just buttery smooth and clear. It's also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db@1W/1M.I don't know how Eminence did it but I love it!"
A1EQYR35KLTECN_B0002E1H9W,Hate the pushdown bottle heads! I like Dunlop products but... The push down applicators (Dunlop's Dab-O-Matic Applicator Tops) are horrible idea.

A2C46HQIZLYJUC_B0002H0N76,"Great strings. They sound great. They helped revive an old acoustic guitar that had been buried in a closet for years (along with a very thorough cleaning). I don't have any opinion on the ""feel"" of these strings like some reviewers. I honestly didn't notice anything different. I bought them because I wanted great strings on an old cheap guitar in order to get the best sound possible. These strings did that just fine. The guitar now sounds great. Job completed."
A3MPMALWL0ERCA_B0002Z2D0I,"Want rubber residue all over your guitar? These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go."
A346EQ2V4W531N_B0002M6CW6,the best these are my personal favorites when it comes to guitar strings.i would reccomend these to everyone and the price is the best
AZPDO6FLSMLFP_B005EHILV4,loved it should have kept this....I returned it cause I purchased a zoom r16....big mistake!! miss it on smaller projects and my mxl990 sounded wonderful when hooked up to this super versital mixer.....my uncle has one and uses it for podcasts on his camping trips with vw freaks! he thinks it great too

Acoustic, electric, and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks."
A31B0LYT2C92SN_B0016ZZKJO,The Analog Delay This unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay. It's not so &#34;digital and bright&#34; delay like Boss DD3 or DD7. Mod switch adds a perfect &#34;chorus&#34; effect for 80's Metal Ballads sound.

A164BJ2NU1NSJZ_B000L3FPUG,Excellent Product This is a great way to easily add or remove a strap to your guitar. If you don't enjoy dealing with a strap getting in the way when sitting and playing but don't like putting a strap on and off or if you just want more peace of mind that your guitar won't slip out of the strap while you're playing then upgrade to this system!
A1TJ393OFP21I8_B00BU9KCXK,"Sturdy, great design, and inexpensive. What a great A-frame stand, especially for the money. It's lightweight but super-stable. I like it so much that I ordered three more. All 7 of my electric guitars fit wonderfully onto the stand, as do my acoustics. The similarly-priced Fender is a FPOS. It leans WAYYY too far back.I couldn't have hoped for more from these stands. Buy one. Buy a couple."
A27DR1VO079F1V_B0010CZ8GS,Great quality This cable is built to last. Overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly. What more could you ask for

AKYDGCKCY7H9F_B002GYWBJ6,"Amp only does modeling (75,120,150) A modeling amp will literally model existing Amps, Artists, and Songs from different years.This amp does not have on board song or drum loops like the Spider Jam.If you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time, then this isyour amp.If you need a practice amp, go with the Jam.I have both amps and as far as I am concerned, the Jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the Spider 4 does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more, even if it is based on the Spider 3 technology with a JM4 Looper as its engine.While the Spider 4 (I have the 150) is a nice amp, it is VERY SPECIFIC to the user needs and isnot that flexible.I do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals, as I used the Jam for a longtime without, and only acquired the Express pedal when I ordered the Spider 4.Also be very aware that the Line 6 documentation on their amps is very, very lacking, to put it mildly, and there so-called on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation."
A1AOD8N6LJYHBU_B000XUUXB8,"This works!! Delivery was Amazon fast, installation took all of 2 minutes and we were making music.  It has worked perfectly from the start and as continued without a flaw for the last 6 months, and we expect it to continue for years.  For the price you can't go wrong.  Mic sound is pristine, no noise, we use it for vocal recording in studio, run it off an M-Audio Mixer Keyboard which lacked Phantom power.  Top Recommendation."

A3FW4THIMBIN6V_B0002D0CEO,"Good Picks If you don't know what type of pick you like, buy a sample pack. Picks make a big difference to sound and playability. These are thin and flexible. Easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general. However the tone is different. So you'll need to decide what songs they work for, etc.As far as quality, these are great. Easy to grip, and as durable as most."
A3M1PLEYNDEYO8_B005FKF1PY,"Neat I have another headstock tuner that I've had for awhile.  This Planet Waves PW is about the half the size and works just as well.  The clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky, but the tuner works like a champ.  Nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions.  Compared to my other tuner, it's rigt on the money.  The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room, I don't have to take the tuner off."
A1URXSRV6WDHVY_B0002FO9QY,"Epiphone is on the case! This Epiphone Hardshell case is a real bargain!  Well built and functional, just the perfect size for your Dot,  Casino, 335 , or in my case a Sheraton II.  Finished in faux leather, a nice scuff resistant vinyl of some sort, much like the old Fender Tolex.  NICE hardware on this case. All the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid. Hinges too.  The handle isn't going anywhere!  Inside you get a nice soft plush interior, the obligatory hinged compartment for strings and things, and a good solid rattle free fit for your guitar.Top all that off with 2 feet on the end for standing upright,  2 well placed feet on the side and 3 on the bottom. NO matter which way you place the case (other than upside down) both your guitar and case are protected.  You get a total of FIVE good quality latches (one of them locks, key included) and hinges at either end. As I said, the hardware on the case is really good.  For under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain.I was immediately struck by how SOLID this case feels.  It is no lightweight either.  I feel totally secure keeping and transporting my Sheraton II in this case and unworried about it breaking apart or popping open, etc.  Mine came almost scuff free out of the box, but there were a few signs that it had been handled a bit before packing. Still, it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price.If I could make just two criticisms, it would be that I notice the stitching appears to be single stitched, rather than double stitched. Also, the strip of fabric that holds the lid open seems overly thin and not well implemented. It is a smallish piece of colored vinyl attached to the lid and case body and it looks like this will be the first thing to wear out or even just up and break.  Also, when you close the case , instead of folding in on itself it tends to stick out the back of the case, necessitating you manually pulling it into the case before fully closing.  I would have much preferred a nice self folding piece covered with the same material that lines the case itself.  This is just a minor niggle and could easily be replaced by either yourself if you are handy, or most any music store with a halfway decent tech in the backroom.I have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon . Overall, I am extremely pleased with this case and my Sheraton II is happy to have found a long term home.  An excellent value, highly recommended!"
AHUIPZZH2UKJG_B0002CZZW4,"Great quality cable This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them. I love their flexibility, options for colors and ends, build quality and price. I like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but I don't need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do."
A3FQ9WYUHG9CD_B001RNHE30,"Looks Great:  Spectraflex Fatso Flex Instrument Cable, Right Angle, Black [21 Foot] This is one great looking cable. I purchased this cable December 2010 and it is still working well and stilllooks good. And as Fernando Lamas says, ""it is better to look good than to feel good"". Well, not when itcomes to cables.This cable is 20 AWG, with an ""Ultra-Pure Copper Center Conductor"" and 100% copper and conductivepolymer shield. You want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud. Helps keep those ugly micro-phonics away and you want that big time.The capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pF/ft. This is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables. The lower the number, the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable.Out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output. It seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed. This seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money.This cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style. They look terrific but I find this ""Fatso"" muchharder to coil than the thinner Spectraflex 'Vintage' this company makes. The bulkiness of this cabledoesn't seem to lend itself to easy coiling. It also seems to become twisted a lot easier and thus harderto straighten out and coil for storage. The easiest of my cables to coil, by the way, is the Lava Cable,""Magma"", which only has a black rubber jacket and is a dream to coil. If I were to need more cable, quitehonestly I would buy the Lava. Pretty doesn't count for much with me.I gave this cable 4 stars because of its very good sound, is well constructed, has excellent shrunk rubbercovering the plugs, looks darn marvelous, and has about average specs for the money. Yet, difficulty incoiling for storage makes it a bit of a pain in the arse to deal with on a nightly basis.If you want a beautiful, well made cable that you don't have to put away every day buy this one."
A2FIYXK97CTS6D_B00646MZHK,"Love my SN-8! Having to send the first Snark SN-8 back, but the replacement, thus far, has been flawless.I made a slight adjustment to my guitar's truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on.A couple tips to tuning a guitar: tune it like you play it. If you strum & play softly, then pluck & tune each string softly.However, most people don't play softly, so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes: they pluck each string and wait like 15 seconds till the ringing fades out, & so they are generally tuning each string as it begins ""softly"" resonating.So, in essence, what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat.To tune your guitar correctly, you really ought to pluck each string hard, like every 2 seconds and tune it that way - rather than waiting for the sound to fade out. If you do it this way, you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you're strumming the living daylight out of it!Also, please check your intonation. Your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings. You pluck your open string (hard) & tune as described above. Then you check intonation by pressing VERY LIGHTLY (with JUST the TIP of your FINGER and DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER PART of the NECK), on the same string, but 12th fret - and BOTH should be in tune the EXACT same.If they are off (12TH & open), then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment. Please don't pay someone to setup your guitar! You can do it yourself so easily. Go on u toob and search ""scott grove tuning your guitar wrong"" and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over 3,000 guitars - & he spends almost an hour explaining all the details. Also, watch his video on how to setup: adjust intonation, truss rod, action, etc.Btw, if you can't get your Snark to tune your guitar: hint - it's not the tuner's fault. The first 3 saddles (e, b, g) should look like a staircase going down. Then, your next 3 strings (d,  a, e) should also look like another staircase going down. If not, break out your philips head & tweak your intonation."
A3ITN3125FJETP_B0002D02RQ,"Pickin! Grabbed these on impulse as I needed some new ones. Normally I used the old Fender Medium or Heavy picks, but I gotta say these are great. Stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely. Not sure what could be said to prove it, but they just feel great."
A1LQC225SE8UNI_B0002H0FMO,"Usual D'Addario quality 80/20 strings ""blend"" really well on my cheap Jasmine guitar. They improve the bass and do not emphasize the tinny sound that inexpensive plywood guitars often exhibit. Phosphor Bronze were way too bright on the Jasmine. 80/20 is good choice for a guitar that needs smoothing out. They did nothing to help my over-braced 1970 Gibson J-50, though. Phosphor Bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap."
A195TE92PMQTJ5_B004FPEF84,"Way better than the the popular Competitor Easy to use.  Wide enough to cover all six strings in one pass.  Little to no excess residue.

A194BLXLSNY8SE_B009AS1FLG,"Works great; cord is absurdly short I bought one of these for myself after using one in a junior high school music program. (I'm a teacher, not a student.) I have only used it with Garage Band, but it works really well. I have used it to record electronic drums, bass guitar (direct out from a multi-effects pedal), vocals, and guitar (with garage band's virtual amps.) I've been very impressed. If you really turn up the gain, you will start to get a lot of noise, but the noise comes well AFTER you get past the point that any reasonable signal is &#34;clipping&#34;-making the light turn red. So, with the gain at 1/3 or so of the way up, you get good clean signal with little to no noise. The cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short. I bought 2 of the same Ziotek extension cable-at the recommendation of Focusrite. One worked, the other didn't. So, yeah, best of luck with that. Focusrite should really have made a longer cable. It gets in the way of the USB power plug a little bit, and makes things awkward. Other than that, I like it a lot."

Yep, I said it, BETTER than a Tubescreamer.This pedal has a wider gain range, far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid 80s 'screamer.The only thing it seems to lack is the &#34;smooth creaminess&#34; of an old 808, but I can easily live with that..This is an amazing TS clone, and for the price, cant be beat."

Designed by Way Huge founder Jeorge Tripps, is a great analog delay for under $175.00. Using bucket brigade circuitry, true bypass and a very simple 3 knob interface, the Carbon Copy is a very flexible unit. Utilizing the ""modulation"" switch, you can achieve a slight chorusing sound (like the flutter from old tape echoes) which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot.The unit has a small footprint (like most MXR pedals) so it is very pedal board friendly.This is truly a great sounding delay so try one out"
AG5L0MYSPPWDC_B004UNL1P6,"Spooky Sounds The Danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with (3V to 9V), by giving less power to them, you can get some really spooky sounds; great fun, but can also help give you your characteristic sound.  I also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet, this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it, like other adapters do.  The price is great, I'm planning to have several of this."

You will have to play with the controls to get the exact settings where its not clipping your sustained notes off before you want it to. It doesn't cut noise while your playing , but when your not it comes on a kills the noise. There are two lights on the pedal, one for the on and off and the other comes on when the pedal is working and reducing noise. If you have it set to high or to sensitive , it will not recognize the end of your sustained note and noise . So play with it and find your personal setting because I'm sure every guitar and pedal board are unique in the sounds that start with your guitar and go through your pedal chain and out your amp. The NR300 works and as soon as you understand how it will do the best job for you , you will be happy with it. Oh, and if you switch it to Mute, it works as an on and off switch.. You also can not beat the price----"
A3V1A3C9DTLPME_B000068O3X,"No frill cordage... Really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together. As of yet, i havent had one go all crackly, which, considering they get frequent use, is pretty good. Often, cheap cords die within a year or so. Every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things, and this one in particular is cheap and accessible. I probably have around twelve of them.Enjoy!"
AEWYUPCNDV7HY_B001PGXJGU,"Good disposable picks If you are prone to losing your guitar picks, this is a good set of 10 picks to have around all in your choice of a single color per pack. The quality is a bit better than the cheap fishbowl picks at the music store, but not as good as my favorite picks,Dunlop Big Stubby Picks, 2.0mm."
A3RHT4KI3H5TVH_B004INGEB4,"small box, big sound beyond stoked! bought so i could teach my son bass...i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box. ampeg will always build my bass rigs, however big or small"
A2XSWF2AJSXQZB_B003JJQMD8,Highest quality for an amazing price! Possibly the best quality mic cable I have come across to date in my hunt for reasonably priced cables and gear. For the working musician or home recording man this is great! Extremely high quality at this price point and are used by professionals all over Southern California and the nation!
A31RULW0KNYJ5H_B00IZCSW3M,"Cadillac of Guitar Strings For a long time, I never thought much about guitar strings. I pretty much thought they were all the same.In fact, guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days. D'Addario has gotten into the act with these NYXL strings, and I have to say that they are not like any other strings I've used.The feel is different, and the sound is different. Different in a WOW way. Yeah, they're more expensive, but they're worth it. I'm a cheapskate, and I can't go back to cheap strings.Now I'm spoiled, and I've become a guitar strings snob."
A18LZ6VHS4DK69_B000ULAP4U,"They sound great, are ruged, comfortalbe.  But they look terrible These headphones are wonderful to wear.  They sound great.  But that's not enough now a days.  With the head band being connected to the outside of the muff, they fit your head so wide.  The pioneer hdj 2000 has the look.  Read my review on those though.  They are terrible.At first glance these things are serious pro grade, they are made of very durable components. Both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head. The head band isn't bad, it's a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued. Not really a big concern though. They have a long cord, and I'll talk more about it later. It ends with a spin on 1/4 in or a standard 3.5mm.The sound out of these things is pristine. It's not muddy and very clear. They have a good amount of bass.  Because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also don't leak noise like a lot of headphones do.Pros- Heavy duty- Awesome sound- Comfortable headband- Over ear design- Not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag- Always clear, never muddy, even at high volumes- Very clear left and right ear markings- Spin on 1/4 PlugCons- Heavy coil cord- Heavy (weight never got annoying though)- Looks"
A1VHYBN1NV73LZ_B007Q28BHE,"High Performance, Low Budget If you don't like too much dirt in your tone, this might be the pedal for you.The Sweet Baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally.If you have a fairly clean single channel amp, it won't give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels.  However, if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking, step on this pedal and you'll be rewarded. If you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp, set the gain low and boost it with this pedal. The notes ring clear with the extra bite, and brightness to cut thru the mix.......sweet! You can use it like a Tubescreamer although the Sweet Baby doesn't color your sound.  (No mid-hump)I use it to boost my Barber Direct Drive, OCD and the dirt channel on my amp.The pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made.  It's not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives.  Instead of a tone knob, it has a ""focus knob"" which controls your picking dynamics and presence.  All the way to the left, the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp.  All the way to the right, when you pick the strings hard, it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence.  The pedal is very transparent, smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well.You can't get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with.This pedal basically takes the sound of your amp, adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control.  I just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob.  At a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after, it's a no brainer."
A362IZKSMV6MA8_B005LYIW3W,"Nice fat overdrive I really like this one as a pre to my Fender Superchamp X2 head, especially on the distortion channel.  It really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones... the only thing to be careful of is the tone knob as that is a HUGE sweeping circuit.  I was not able to get it even close to 1/2 way without it being just ugly, but that might be preference.  Also of note is that I ran my Fender Mustang bass guitar through this (active pickups) and I loved the grit that it gave the sound.  This is a great pedal for the $$ and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand.  Very nice work Joyo, I will be buying more of your pedals for sure."
AAYAXHC63IX1D_B0002E1O7M,"Great Strings !! It was time for a change after many years of using the same strings and I am really glad I tried Elixir. They feel really nice and sound awesome, I will be sticking with these now, thanks for the good and prompt service as well Cheers !!!"
A310MXGFV4RIK0_B000978D58,"Nice stand This mic stand does everything it says it will, and is adjustable in every conceivable way. In fact, the boom has a really nice adjusting lever, making it easy to loosen and tighten. The only drawback I found is the tripod configuration of its feet, making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances; especially when you're emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on. I would much prefer a round base. Other than that, it makes for a great home/garage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin' it. 'Nuff said."
A3UXW18DP4WSD6_B001PGXHW6,"work fine the reason I bought them is I only needed a few, I live in BFE and there is no real place to buy any on my drive home from work, so I got these and delivered to my doorstep,, all is well with the world"
A2TBAUW2W7J538_B0002E1O7W,"The best acoustic strings, period. By far the best acoustic strings, period. They sound great, and last forever. TheElixir Nanoweb Electric Custom Light Guitar Stringsare the best electric strings ever, and these are the best acoustic strings. Fantastic."
A2Y4PRG2HHOL3G_B000XPRQIG,"Great purchase I have been using those webbed, nylon & sometimes cutting straps for years 'cause they were inexpensive (but not cheap). Don't know why I waited so long. Quality in this baby! ... comfortable too!"
A2MFJ6C67AL015_B005CX4GLE,Guitar Hanger I couldn't say that I loved it. It's only a guitar hanger. It just holds a guitar. If I needed another I would buy this type.
A2T8TWZAWLQWBV_B0025V1REU,"It's OK I like the drum machine and the tuner, but I don't like the effects, I don't have an electric guitar, I only have acoustic electric guitars, and I thought that maybe I could make it sound like an electric, but the sounds are distorted, and not very clean, it sound muff.For an electric guitar maybe it would work fine, but not for an acoustic electric guitar."
ALVPGO19QI1SC_B000EELFTW,"Great for people with a fat neck The harmonica barely fits the holder, and there is no adjustment for distance from the mouth to the harmonica. I can't get the harmonica adjusted close enough to play it, unless I modify it."
AIAH54R6EL4V8_B007K3EGWI,"You can't go wrong with aquila! You can't go wrong with aquila. Amazing song, very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too.Long lasting, made with quality. Improves the sound greatly on less expensive ukes in other wordsit can make a 50 dollar uke sound like a 100 dollar uke!"
AXXYMIJBD0J9G_B003VWJ2K8,"The Best Tuner I have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners.  The Snark SN-1 is, by far, the best.  It is acurate and picks up the vibration of the low A and E strings without a problem."
A1LU9607CVAMIF_B0002E2KPC,"For the price, works well Works as described.  For the price I have no complaints at all. Clamps firmly and easily, doesn't move or slide around on either of my electric and acoustic."
A20TFY5J3WNJU2_B0002KZEAE,Sound great Perfect for my guitars. Sounds great for my telecaster and my Stratocaster guitars. Capacitor are a nice generalized  choice. Excellent choice.
A7WNXHL0QNHY7_B003VWKPHC,"Good and cheap but not exact Easy to use, portable, cheap.  Not exact in tuning, might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican.  For most of us this is more than adequate."
A32264FNDHOH3Q_B001GH4H3W,"great amp i do like this for playing at home, but it is what it is is by no means a replacement for my 15&#34; tnt peavey but works as it says and the shipping was quick"
A1UPZM995ZAH90_B0002F7K7Y,"great strings I've been using these strings for years. Tried a bunch of others as well, but these suckers keep coming out on top. Probably will never stop buying them."
A35M5X7LV6QLFT_B000VOBU9U,Little on price - high on features I spent a lot of time on Amazon reading reviews - comparing prices. I wanted an amp that would have overdrive and I also wanted some power. There are so many choices from the small portable units (I was afraid they would sound like toys) to the big units (They would sound great but I couldn't afford them). I am thrilled with the Starcaster. This amp delivers a huge sound and the overdrive sounds great for grunge and metal while you can also play crisp clear rock or country through it. If you want a small amp to take anywhere and be able to show your rock star image - this is the one for you.
A1VBRBWX7SVCVX_B001XJBWXG,Good to have. It fits well on my Les Paul and Strat.  Does Not fly off the head when playing.  It's very easy to read with or without the back light being on depending on room ambient lighting.  The light works really well and that was what I was looking for.  As far as accuracy it's right on in either setting.
A3G21YYF2EXCS8_B0016ML1C2,"Replacing foot pedal I replaced my delay foot pedal with the Behringer VD400 Analog Delay. For the money it is a more than a competent addition to my pedal board . It is doing exactly what I expected and much more. The big name delay I replaced , in all honesty , wasn't as good. I have more room and control with this pedal. Also I can buy six of these pedals for what I paid for the last one ... You do the math!!!!"
AJ3MI4QT7339J_B0002F58TG,its ok not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all...but ya get what ya pay for ....so i'll keep it anyway
A3FW4THIMBIN6V_B0073XCXHA,"Subtly Better than Previous Snarks I was hesitant to purchase this, as I really like the display of the previous models. At first it seems like it might be less accurate. It has less granularity in the display for example. However, it does seem to respond noticeably faster. It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes. And it may in fact be more precise, though it takes learning how to work with the display.On earlier Snarks, the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note. And they seemed pretty dead on, especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string. But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune. (Though once you get used to it, it is easily avoided.)Anyway, on this unit, I am not sure what each bar represents, but it is very sensitive. If the string is not quite perfect, the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit up, but so will one next to it. Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on. Then only the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit (unless you turn too far). And the result sounds really right."
A1JCRZEQACX4V4_B004J27QXY,"Surprisingly useful You may have experienced the problems of musicians. The drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late. But you need to rehearse. This gets the job done, you can lay down rhythm lines and drum lines and get the sound you want. The thing to remember is that whatever effect you are using for the lead, will kick in on any recording playback as they use the same input jack. Otherwise, easy and a great product. The best is, that if you are playing really poor lead work, nobody can hear but you! lol."
A280VP2CL6ZFZZ_B0002GTZR6,Long enough! I love dunlop straps because I'm a tall guy and they're long enough for me not to look like an electric-guitar-playing-mariachi.
A1TF131MUR8E2E_B0064BFNME,"As always excellent quality. I recently got myself a Kenny Wayne Shepherd Stratocaster guitar, I decided that since the guitar he had a set of tens strings installed I would go with these.They work flawlessly.The qualities excellent cannot go wrong with Ernie Ball strings no matter what gauge you get."
A24JW33E1DW64K_B000CD1R7K,"great foot rest Great foot rest, it's not flimsy.  But it's not light weight.  I put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and I definitely feel that it's there.  I like that it's adjustable to various heights.  I am short (5'1"") so I usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when I'm playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle.  But I sometimes adjust it down when I switch it to my right leg and when I'm playing Flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture, I shift it over to my right leg.  I ended up getting a 2nd one so that I keep the one at the highest setting for when I'm playing classical, and then the other one at the lower setting for my Flamenco playing.  Great foot rest, I recommend it."
A3ARSPDQYDZVNS_B003B0I09Y,"Great for its intended purpose, do not buy the cradle! I have used the Manhasset orchestra light, and this is definitely an improvement, it distributes a nice soft light evenly through the whole page, unlike the Manhasset light which tends to be rather uneven.  It illuminates my entire largeManhasset M54 Regal Conductor's Music Standquite well by itself.Having said that, for a 40 bucks light, it feels rather flimsy to me. In both construction and light brightness, it does not compare well with traditional clamp or desk lights, all of which are usually much cheaper (the issue being mainly the light switch, the jury is out about the clamp, though it seems strong). Of course, as an orchestra light, it couldn't be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose, I am just pointing out that I feel it isn't worth 40 dollars, when you consider the whole field of similar lights (those not intended for orchestra).I bought this because of reputation and reviews, but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor, theRechargeable Music Stand LED Light Clip-on 9 LEDS with Adapter.  That one has the same negative issues as this light, but at a much more acceptable $18.99 plus free shipping.One more thing, you should ignore the ""Frequently Bought Together"" suggestion to get theMighty Bright 80910 Bright Light Cradlefor this light.  I bought it, and can confirm they are totally incompatible, and anyways, this light has a huge clamp which can be used to carefully balance the light on a desk without clamping, if desired."
A3RDS0DJ5EJGA7_B000OMG0KI,"Seems like it works but... ...two weeks in and I can already feel it drying up. Good for peace of mind instead of using a wet sponge humidifier and just keeping the humidity controlled, but it seems it will cost me a fortune if I keep using these."
A26NQIGPSFBU5Z_B0037M62JQ,"Better than Nylon! I got this strap just to try something different than a nylon. At first it was kind of weird since the strap grips your shirt a little bit and wrinkles it up if you try to move it around. But after a while I found it a quite useful feature of this strap because your guitar wont slide around when you're playing and will stay nice and steady while playing. Those with neck heavy guitars might also want to give this a shot since it grips so well. It is also very long, longer than i thought. I have it slung a little low, and there's plenty of slack left on the strap. So it's probably long enough for Shaq to use it and still sling it as low as James Hetfield.  The only complaint I have about this guitar is the fact that it was a little tough to get on my epiphone les paul. But again it adds another feature to the strap, since the thing isn't falling off anytime soon! I almost feel like I wont even need strap locks it's so good. Also the holes are very strong and have not torn open at all, which usually happens on a heavy guitar like the one I have.  All in all a perfect buy for the money."
AA1ZYCEKJGG3A_B000ZJTPLG,"Stick with the AC30 or better yet use your Iphone/computer as an amp I used AC30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these.Sound quality of AC30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).Even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy AC30, the latter has acceptable cleans.."
A3MZWM75KSM1P6_B003VWJ2K8,No more guesswork tuning my guitar One of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune.  With this little gadget there is no guess work.  Clamp it onto the headstock of your guitar and pluck each string and bring each one into tune. I love this little gadget and the price is super on Amazon!
A395RVQDH28EK9_B00178LDW8,Dreamy I've had this for 4 days and I'm so glad I bought it. Its basically a top end 2 second delay with whistles and bells you wouldn't even think they would be on there. I have had ALOT of delay pedals and this thing is limitless except for the 2 second loop capabilities.
A2Y4PRG2HHOL3G_B003GEBGA0,"Worth five times the price! All I can say is, sometimes you get more than what you paid for. While this isn't the new break through tech or the rave of the much, much higher end mics, it does deliver. With a decent mixer you can get a very nice response. Been giggin' since the early 70's and have been hosting an open-mic to boot. I get some seasoned players that grace my stage and none were the wiser of this very nice, super affordable microphone ... it's a charm! 'b' B"
A3KNGMX2RVQG91_B000EEHKVY,"I trust  this stand with my Fender Custom Jazz Bass I had been leery about leaving my Fender 5 string Custom Jazz bass on guitar stands until I met the Hercules GS414B.  The stand is ""built like a tank"" with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly.  My bass weighs about 9.5 pounds with the strap and with its long neck, fits perfectly in the Hercules, with the body of the bass resting  well-balanced against the padded legs.The design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and I experimented with trying to tip the bass over. It will take more than  an ""accident"" to tip the bass off its stand.  The self-closing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlock.The lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism.  The lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand.My only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism. I would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black."
A3H4PZB9PGMWAA_B0002M6CW6,... i use these on my strat and it feels good and sounds amazing Very clean very bright strings i use these on my strat and it feels good and sounds amazing. if you want to use these strings for distortion you're an idiot these are something i could imagine david gilmore using
A14V6CXN8ZWZOS_B0002H0A3S,Best strings for the money! I've use these strings for years. I play often and like to change strings often. I can do it without breaking the bank and they hold up well for many practices and gigs. They hold tune very we (at least on my guitar) indoors and out. I'd highly recommend them.
AGW1JFTQNX7SZ_B0002H0A3S,"The are what I use I have used all kinds of strings. These are what I use on a regular basis. They work, they sound great, and their longevity is impressive. Most of all, they are cheap."
A27L5L6I7OSV5B_B0002MSQVQ,"My go-to distortion... I've owned over 3 dozen dirt boxes over the years, and I just love the Rat.  It makes my tube halfstack sing, and my practice amp sound like a big amp.Its great as a stand alone distortion, running on a clean amp.  It can get everything from that perfect bluesy grit to roaring sludge (just max out the distortion and use your neck pickup on an LP to sound EXACTLY like King Buzzo of the Melvins) and everything inbetween.It can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory.  Case in point, my buddy has an old Peavy stack from the 70's in his garage.  Its a solid state head on top of a vertical cab of two 14"" speakers.  On its own, you can use the gain and distortion knobs present on the amp to get a decent sound, but with his Les Paul it still sounded oddly dark.  We put the Rat in front of it and with some fiddling got that perfect AC/DC style overdrive out of it.I think the main reason I love the Rat so much is not only the great tone and its sheer indestructability, but the filter knob.  Normal tone knobs allow you to focus more on bass or treble, but usually if you boost one, you cut the other.  The filter is more of a high end roll off, you can darken or brighten your tone accordingly, but when you DO go brighter, you still have the same bottom end.  It doesn't CUT the bass out.  So even with a more treble heavy sound, you still have a fuller rounder tone, it doesn't thin out so much.Its really an excellent pedal.  I've heard that some claim you have to get an older one with the LM308 chip to really get ""the sound"" but that's a myth.  Look on a few guitar forums or on youtube for plenty of tests and testimony showing the fact that the new ones do indeed sound the same as the old ones.  A Rat is a Rat, whether they're coming from China or the USA.p.s.  Mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark.  So I dunno what that other guy was complaining about."
A3F49ZMUC1GSRP_B000RNB720,YAY!! No more batteries!! This seems like a good product. It is working well for me and the chord is super long which is great. Too long is better than too short!!

ASG42G9QTBUX1_B0002KZEMC,"Genuine fender Genuine fender pick guard.  It's pre-shielded.  Perfect for your next build, or for replacing your standard white guard to set you apart."
A15BHBF0L0HV1F_B0002D0E8S,"Nothing Special Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage, it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small &#34;thumbs up&#34; to Amazon."
A2SKZZZBV1XYWP_B0002E1G5C,Time Saver Great quality product. Saves me time winding plus includes a string cutter which is awesome. Highly recommended
A11E4FWMN9BXJD_B000LQLDM2,"Superior shockmount, fantastic price! I don't think I can say enough good things about the Samson SP01 Shockmount.  Long story short I was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago.  I did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording.  A shockmount is an absolute must, especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surface.The build quality is fantastic.  I just recently purchased my THIRD shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcast.What I've grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone I can get my hands on.  If you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic, make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount.  Nearly all do, but some companies like Blue (Snowball, snowflake, etc.) are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts. I have used the MXL 007.USB with this shockmount as well as the AT2020 USB and XLR version.  The MXL fit like a glove, perfect.  The AT2020, once threaded in, seemed just a bit loose, so I added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer.  It made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movement.In short, I haven't found a better shockmount for condenser mics.  The attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand.  Fantastic.  Buy two of these!!  :)  Thanks Samson, now just make better mics!"
AJCAVTHZFM0J3_B0002F741Q,Okay - Not for My Drums but for Rock Band :( sad right?i do play instruments (guitar & piano) some drums but it's not why i bought these drum sticks.My old roommmate stole my drum sticks so this was the next cheapest thingthey play well on the pads.i'm sure they'd have nice action off a snare drum and high hat in real life...
A3GHV54CDBCKO4_B0018SJLFS,"Very Unhappy with the performance and quality I had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so I experimented and replaced all the tubes.  Issues not only continued but worsened.  Hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes.  I eventually put back the original El84s and that didn't help.  Once I removed the Tung-Sol 12AX7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par.  My experience with the Tung-Sol tubes was very, very negative.  They caused me to go out and buy another amp.  I had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast.  I'll never buy this brand again."
A20EZ7E8WUH2GZ_B00009W40D,Nice Surprise We bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long.  I hope it does because this nady sp-4c is a very impressive mic for the price.  We our using it with our Roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a Roland micro cube also.  I would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose.
A1AOD8N6LJYHBU_B000JRPYGE,"Very good Quality mic for the price Really a remarkable microphone for around $100.  Very sensitive . . . its for studio, not live performances.  Be sure to set your DAW insert on your input channel with a compressor/limiter, as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping.  Has a rich warm tone, like tube mics.  Compares to a Audio Tech 2020, not in the class of say an Audio Tech 4040.  Can't beat it for the price."
A37KK1CLMULHE4_B003OUX8ZM,"Good for practice For any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. Direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.I didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred Amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.That being said, it is good for practice and song writing. Used this for more than a year and finally sold it! That's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out."
A3DOXGBWDJ1MU0_B003VWKPHC,Great tuner This is a great tuner. High quality construction. The tuning is accurate. The controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read. It is far superior to a Fishman tuner that I bought previously. The Fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate. These tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing.
A298INOY52JEH8_B002MWKOAA,"This is the best I was so excited to discover that you can buy these on their own. I am a huge devotee of Dunlop strap locks -- having dropped both my electric guitar and my bass on stage at one time or another, I have now installed these on all my main performing guitars.So it was a given that when I started gigging with a new bass, I would put strap locks on it. But I already have my fancy bass strap decked out with the lock mechanisms, so I really only needed these buttons. I was on the verge of resigning myself to buying the whole set again and throwing the extra strap lock parts into a drawer when I found these. Buying the buttons alone cost less than half what the whole set would have, and now I can just shuttle my one bass strap between both instruments.I did have some major difficulty getting one of the two screws all the way tightened, but since I have attached strap lock buttons at least four other times and it was easy as pie, I'm more inclined to blame my instrument for that.Great product. I'm elated to know I can now get these buttons separately."
A2HDEN9SPBWC5I_B000L6GD04,"Great Locking Tuners I put this puppy on in 15 minutes or less. They fit perfect on my American Standard Stratocaster. They work like a charm. If you play guitar and like to keep your strings in tune on your strat. This are a no brainier, the price is right, and they look great on your stratocaster."
A1Q3YZOVFXRKDZ_B0002GTZR6,another great strap as I said on my last Dunlop strap reviewI love the Dunlop Guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product I have 4 or 5 of them.when I buy a guitar I buy a Dunlop strap and Strap locks always to protect my investment.
A1MAQQXJZTMSKT_B005E0CPNG,Not for side by sides. I recently purchased a Epiphone EB-3 bass and it didn't come with a case/bag. So when I found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try. It is VERY thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really. Not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine. All in all it's an okay bag but only if you have an inline and don't want much padding.
A2GVH4P25TXN8M_B000EEJAFS,"Great picks - love the turtles I've been using Dunlap's Tortex picks now for going on 10 years, and recently just switched over to heavy Jazz picks (smaller - sharper tip). These picks work great. They provide enough surface area that they won't slip easily from between your fingers. They allow for a high level of sensory feedback from your fingertips once you get used to them. Any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use. I also prefer the high thickness so there's no flex in the pick while playing which makes it easy to judge the pressure you're putting on the strings."
A3UD50M7M72150_B001G3TJXO,"Perfect size Tried several of pedaltrain in the past (pt-3 too bulky, and pt-jr a little to small), this one holds my pedals perfectly. Simple & light. I love it!"
A2PP4G3DLGDD4T_B0027842S4,"Very well constructed. Assembled the stand in seconds. It is very stable and solidly constructed. Should last a life-time. Very, very good value."
A1EVEQAR05SY7L_B004N0MKN8,Not as helpful as it would appear to be I just can't trust it! I thought it'd be a good idea if I needed to prop my guitar up against the amp for a minute....but I just can't get myself to do it. I always end up using a little Fender portable stand. It does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp.
A3EU3ET85O8ZFX_B0002GIRP2,Astonishing microphone man ya'll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it's all good and stuff man. because like when you be spittin some siK leeriX and all like i be going in the paint like weezy and eminem ya feel me.ay yo let's go.
A27V6PS7Y83OIV_B0017HZ47Y,"Good bag and good value for the price This is my second Makala gig bag. The first was a smaller size for my MK-C concert uke, the second was the one above that I purchased for my Oscar Schmidt Tenor OU6.My OU6 actually came with an O.S. logo'd gig bag included, but while I love the uke the bag was PA-thetic. Single layer of fabric providing no protection. After comparing that bag to the one for my Makala uke, I came straight to this page and ordered another Makala bag.Why do I like this bag better? Its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside.  You can carry it around, set it down, let it roll around the back seat of your car (a little) without blemish to your instrument.  As good as a hard case?  Of course not. But very good for a bag.I also like the fact that there's no logo on the outside. I can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke I want inside. That was a disappointment for another reviewer, for me it's a plus.What don't I like?  The dorky pad around the handle.  Both my concert & tenor bags had the handle pad and the first project for both was to remove it.  It's not as if the uke inside weighs so much you need a special pad for the handle!  And it just looks better without it."
A30J7WQV0ZNRXG_B005FKF1PY,"Small but fragile and not so easily portable I have used many clip-on guitar tuners. They are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument. One of my favorites has become the Planet Waves clip on. I have several of them and use them often on many guitars. Based on this experience, I was anticipating a better experience with this new Mini Headstock Tuner than I wound up getting.It tunes nicely and, so far as my ear is concerned, accurately. Others found it awkward to attach - I did not. It is small and unobtrusive but easy to read. Those are not problems. What is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device.This fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and, more importantly, in the too-delicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrument.The fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the Planet Waves tuners to the guitars, this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp. This clamp is made out of thin plastic, is difficult to adjust and I expect it to break after only a short time. Consequently, I cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.If the need is for a tuner that attaches to ONE instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. If you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of Planet Waves tuners.November 28,2011 UPDATEHaving used this tuner for a while now, I have found that it has a good purpose. While this tuned does have mobility issues as I initially noted, I have been surprised (and pleased)to realize that they are wonderful 'permanent' tuners for acoustic guitars! They are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible. I leave them on my 12-strings and one of the 6's. A non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat. Based on this belated realization, I have raised the product rating to 4-stars."
A3R8XCQYDNQIAA_B000WGJ71U,It's okay Not as good as the headstock tuner I purchased. I used it a few times. It can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic.  I wouldn't buy another one.
AQT4V74P38PPU_B0002CZZW4,"Great Cable Rugged ends very flexible seem like this cable should hold up very well , does not tangle which is a real plus if you tend to move around a lot , connectors seem to be heavy duty , time will tell but I would assume that this cable should last a long time ."
A1OV2BH2S11KBA_B001REJX1U,"Another loser company producing a broke @$$ product they didn't test I really wanted this to be a great product.  The screws strip out too easily.  Basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out.  I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon.  Nope.  Even the pop filter fell off.  I LOVE the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex:  adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc.  Otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option.  Just make it one solid piece.  I'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design.  It's just not strong enough.  Not that it's a surprise though.  Not much of anything is worth the money these days.  It's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products.  Why should they?  They already have your money.  I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up.  Besides, what are they going to do?  Replace it with another broke a$$ product?  Better yet, refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping????  That doesn't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place.  I want a refund, plus an hourly wage.  Whatever, don't buy one.  Companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business.  What would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s):  Did you test this product?  How did you test it?  What were your results?  Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?Nope"
ABKNRVFFLEA3M_B00GTSM8FW,"Upgrade I have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one.  However, it seems theu have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint.  Yhey have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included.  This bracket holds the NS micro tuner, of which I have 3.  I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications.  However, now, this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need.  A simple modification, but bordering on genius.  The capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw/spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed.  Highly recommended."
A1IJUUNPU7L6LA_B001RNOHHG,"I finally found just the right unit for my music equip needs I'm not on tour with any group.  I play for church, and every couple of weeks for a local nursing home (with other musicians willing to give their time) plus an occasional 'gig' for a town celebration or some such activity.  I've got a few sound effects pedals and processors I like using, but not enough to warrant buying your typical pedal board that holds 6 or more such devices and takes up a lot of trunk space in the car.  This 'mini' PedalTrain easily holds four of my favorite devices, it is built for extreme durability without being too heavy, etc.  The case is awesome, too.... heavy duty,...good stuff.  The board came with velcro, tie wraps, power head, etc to mount and use your devices.  I had it up and running in a few minutes,...and it makes my travel-and-play experiences easy, without looking for a 'roadie' to get help.  The angle of the mounting surface of the board relative to floor surface is perfect.  Clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect.  Since I first got it, I've 'rearranged' once already.  Talk about easy.  You'll be glad to have your sound effects mounted, wired, and movable as a unit so as to reduce setup time and the wear/tear on wires from just handling."
A3K24MXK7GFY8_B005IGFGWI,"I went from Dunlop to Schaller About ten years ago, I installed strap locks on my first guitar (Fender Stratocaster). They worked well and were easy to install. I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results: the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation. I had to drill additional holes no two guitars (Gibson SGs). Ouch.This made me take a second look at Schaller. The components, beginning with the screws, are of much higher quality than Dunlop. It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice. I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning. I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results."
A1EMTRDX5PBNCP_B001GH4H3W,"Oh for better eye sight! Liked the sound, the adjustability, just wish I could read the numbers on the dials as my ears are still ringing from turning the dial the wrong way! I find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid. I don't care about disturbing the neighbours, but it is handy to have a portable solution when traveling, the Rumble 75 is a bit big to take everywhere. I made sure to match it with good bass headphones which other reviewers have said is a must."
A3E6FHS8DV037H_B000J5XS3C,"Iffy I bought mine used.  When I got it in, it didn't work.  There was either something wrong with the power cable or the power input in the board.  Behringer uses a custom power supply, so I had no way of testing it.  I had to send it back for a refund.  I read other reviews that have had the same problem, so it seems to be an occasional issue.However, I've used one of these boards before.  The one I used back then was fantastic and everything I needed for small projects."
AENULRBQ2IE5I_B0002KZIVY,"looks cool But didnt work on the el cheapo drop in pickguard/pickup setup that I got here on Amazon. Other than that, they look cool in the package. LOLI suppose this gives me a reason to build a whole other guitar just to use these covers. ahahahahahahYeah, thats right...."
A1SCWHXAB2ZK7N_B004FPEF84,"Good stuff Only used it a couple times so far but I like it. I like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar. As someone else mentioned it's hard to get the cloth back into the clear plastic bag inside the lid, though. But otherwise I think it's great. I like how it smells (does that make me strange?)."
A3ITN3125FJETP_B0002E2G24,Switch it up! Great solid switch. Works well for giving your Telecaster the option to run your pickups in both series and parallel.  As for those who have questioned if the travel is too much for some switch plates all I can say is that I have this in several of my Teles and I have never had a problem with the switch travel being too much for the plate.
AXMYGK3WC8BPP_B004XNK7AI,"This beats the pants off of any built in tuner and colorful display is easy to read in sunlight! I used this tuner as I transitioned from playing Rocksmith to playing in the real world. My amp had a built in tuner, but it seemed to give inconsistent readings. With this tuner, it doesn't matter if it is electric or acoustic, it gives a very very accurate reading. My luthier tunes by ear and when we tested against it, they were only off by 2 units in any given direction. Very happy and pleased with this one."
A1EUO0BU72JR7T_B0006ZXG00,"Improvement over plastic pins for function.. I replaced the nasty, crooked, chipping plastic pins for these, and they work very well in keeping the strings where they should be.  I'm not convinced that they change the sound of my D-28 very much for better or worse.  I replaced one pin at a time and compared strings and really couldn't tell much of a difference, still they are better to handle and remove than the nasty plastic ones, so I consider them an upgrade."
A1P11QY9RR3IA7_B003AAEGZ2,Great Pedal Very fun to use.Comes with a power supply.Very easy to control.I enjoy using this to play alone - It is easy to lay down a rhythm and then play over it.It can be used for drum tracks or to practice a section of a song that you want to repeat.
A2AJKYCZ1WC4UP_B001PGXHX0,Good picks These are good picks and produce a great tone.  They're better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers.
A1AU5K3JMPS3UQ_B0002M3OVI,"A Good Purchase I was pleasantly surprised of how heavy the base was compared to what I was expecting. The adjustable stand also works great and won't fall on you or anything. I bought this and a mic/boom stand for my Samson SP01 Shockmount (which the Audio-Technica condenser mic is on), however its connecting slot is a 3/8in female while this stand has a 5/8in male (same with the mic/boom stand). So just make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect properly with the stand. If not, just buy a cheap (about 6$) adapter like I did."

A7ZP18XOIJADI_B0002E1O3G,"Almost the best..... While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled, the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very, very smooth to play and the sound is amazing, I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric, and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat, mellow, sweet sound."

A3FQ9WYUHG9CD_B001OLZYUU,"14-5/8"" X 12"" and a Warning:  Fender Treated Polish Cloth -> Photos &lt;- This Fender Treated Polish Cloth; a soft ecru colored cloth with a cut scalloped edge all around is asimple product. The classic Fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth. The resealableplastic bag this cloth came in had a label that read, 'FENPC1' and states it's size as being, 12 inchesby 15 inches.Well, its size, as I measured it, is actually 12 inches by 14-5/8 inches. Just wanted to mention itbecause I have seen some people get mighty upset about things like this. Me, no problem. The missing3/8 of an inch is a minor detail. Go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s. Now, you won'tactually find any actual '2x4's. They've been shrinking for over 50 years.I am not sure what this cloth is *treated* with but it does not feel any different than the UN-treatedGibson polishing cloths I have purchased. I also gave it the nose test. I thought there  might be a hintof, or a whiff of, some polish or something. Nope. No scent. No whiff.What I did find disconcerting is the warning in 'Product Details' section on the Amazon web page. It isthe fourth bullet down: ""California residents: Click here for Proposition 65 warning.""  Below is thewarning verbatim from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon for posting this warning.* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ** ""California's Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that* contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other* reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain* threshold levels. We care about our customers' safety and hope that the information below* helps with your buying decisions.* We are providing the following warning for products linked to this page:* WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer* and birth defects or other reproductive harm.""* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *Just thought I let you know about that one. I guess the missing 3/8s of an inch  is really no big deal atthis point. You just need to worry that, in your concerns for keeping your beautiful guitar sparkling clean,you could get cancer. WoW.  Back to the review...The Fender cloth is just as soft and just a little bit bigger than the Gibson cloths but not much differencebetween the two. Well, the Gibson cloth does have a whip-stitch edging around it. Other than THAT, notmuch difference.When I use the Fender cloth on my Fender guitar there were no marks left and no smudges left. I  like tokeep the neck especially clean and polished on a regular basis and it seemed to do a good job at that. Idon't use it on the body that much because it is not as exposed to my dirty oily hands as much as theneck.So, based on the fact that Fender made a cloth that does not scratch or smudge my guitar I will give thisamazingly boring and uninteresting ecru colored cloth 4 stars. It appears to do  what it supposed to do,and that is polish your guitar without harming it.It gets one less star because of the California Prop 65 warning. I suppose I need to take this a somewhatseriously so I docked it one star. I will definitely be washing my hand right after using it.So far no harm has been done to any guitars in the writing of this review. For the future I am not so sureabout me. Thank you, and say, 'Goodnight', Gracie......Note About Vendor: GO-DPS responded admirably when my cloth did not show up on time. It was 4 dayspast the delivery date. I e-mailed them. They responded quickly and then put another cloth in the mail tome that came in an appropriate amount of time. For such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service. I will use them again in the future."
A2BRXREMT5WZJ0_B00006LVEU,"It's magic in a can I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars, basses, amps, FX, MIDI gear, etc.  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs), input and output jacks that are crackly, etc.In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner, which is provided in a similar can. It would rarely work.In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks. It's really like magic in a can."

It went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time. After talking to Larry Hartke, decided I got a bad tube. He would not send a warranty replacement. My suggestion - new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation. Replace all stock tubes with tested tubes from someone like Doug's tubes, tube depot, eurotubes, or some other reputable tube vendor. I don' t trust ebay tubes and won't spend the hard earned cash on NOS. Replaced with a JJ, but should have used a Tungsol reissue."

This guitar rings like a bell, stays in tune and is light weight. Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes. Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play. The strings may be too high or too light or whatever, just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well. Do not buy a Luna, Davidson, Main Street, or any other 'no name' - get this one."

On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad.  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."

A20JJ8634DG3FS_B002B8EWVW,"For the price, a pretty good deal. But cheapish construction. This pedal is ""ok"" by which I mean, I provides the basic functions it says it does. Quality-wise, it feels a bit cheapish....I was afraid I was going to snap a pot off or something while playing it. The case is metal but feels like the thinnest sheet metal they could get away with building it from. The power switch and chorus/vibrato switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find, and are not that easily accessible by a toe...you gotta bend over and flip those. They are small.On the other hand it was only sixty-nine-bucks - relatively inexpensive for a multifunction effect pedal.I don't care for the rear facing upwardly angled input, output and power jacks. That's not pedal board friendly in my opinion. Nice as a tabletop effect. The footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 7.75"" x 6.5"" (approx). The ""standard"" 9V center negative power supply is a ""postive"" (excuse my pun.)If you are looking for a way to play with signal modulation - echos, vibratos, reverbs, old style choruses...this is not a bad way to get started playing with that. You can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank.Personally, I have other effects that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space, so for me...not a keeper. Your situation might be different than mine.Not a bad product, acceptable at it's price point, just didn't impress me much."
AJK15Q9JOEHRH_B0002GOJZO,"My favorite pick! Firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick. They are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold, I can play all night without dropping it."
A3BTH66WVCQAM9_B0002IAJ56,"Excellent for pedal board These are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price. I love the flat, low profile, right angle plugs. My only complaint is I needed some in varying lengths (like 15&#34;) and so I had to order the Planet waves kit to make my own to finish the pedalboard."
AD4QZUGLI9OSK_B001EC5ECW,Footswitch You need this to get the most out of your Super-Champ XD amp. The only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic. No telling how long the switches will last? Fender tends to make good products. Price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp IMO.
A306NASGVUDFKF_B00JBIVXGC,"I really like these strings I really like these strings.  While they are not quite as bright sounding as uncoated strings, they still sound better than many other strings, AND they last so much longer.  They will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x... probably closer to 3x.  Nice tactile feel on the right hand with reduced squeak as you move up & down the neck.Bottom line is Elixir's sound great, play well and least a really long time."
A1YAAMQT5G88XE_B001NXDSK2,"Funnest Muff I've owned just about every muff.  No Triangle or Civil War.  But this is my favorite muff thus far.  Way more versatile than any other muff.  The switches involment in the the circuit really isn't too elaborate, but then again all bypasses aren't.  I love wicker on and tone off.  Cuts like a buffalo.  I hate to have a bunch of fuzz's and distortions in my chain, but its there right next to a Keeley Fuzz Head, a Analogman Peppermint Fuzz, and a TS-9 modded to an 808 w/ Brown that I modded myself.  I love this Muff!  I can't wait to see what they do next.  Plus...  These new EHX pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass.  If you like muffs, you'll really like this one.  If you didn't like muffs before, you'll probably like the wicker feature, it makes it far more clear and pronounced and less of a glob a goo and more distortion/ fuzz friendly.  I give it four stars, because the five is only meant meant for devices that you just freak out and half to have, for me the Keeley Fuzz Head is a five, I love that thing."
A2CA4YBYSETM02_B0002GLDQM,"Stays on my guitar I have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body.  People watching me can't really see it, and it's right where I need it, full of picks, if I drop one.  Wonderful little invention.  Buy it, if you don't want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket."
A1CKZGG8OQ2DTS_B0002H0A3S,D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings I put these strings on every acoustic I own.  They sound great and are priced right!  You can't go wrong with D'Addario strings!
A4M7GUJ0MKZD4_B0009EQOES,GREAT DEAL they don't cost a lot and they work well.  They are inexpensive and they work.  I have purchased 5 of these for my guitars and they are nice
A13T4T3QOSII3I_B0002GZBLU,"Great strap This bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price. BTW, that's all I have to say, so don't MAKE me type more."
A1OZ7F08MNF320_B0002T67J2,great these are great cables but i gave it a four because i after playing the cheap rotosound cables i learned they are just as good and are only 3 bucks. still a great cable and these sound slightly better than rotosound but thats if you are super observant because their isnt much of a difference.
A3AZ44SMA0QNW7_B001EC5ECW,Completes your Super Champ X2. I bought this to go with my Super Champ X2 combo.  It works.  It also came with a cord.I was not happy the Super Champ X2 didn't come with it.  Both my Hot Rod Deluxe and Blues DeVille came with foot switches.  And you really need the foot switch to use the X2's various voicings and effects. Now the X2 is my main amp.
A39JMLMY96E8CP_B0002E528E,Good Seat I sit. I drum. It works.  There's not much to say except that it get the job done very well.
A3FSC2BQQHFXWT_B00AZUAORE,Great simple looper for rehearsing. For performing I'd go with something a little higher quality replay and more features but for rehearsing lead lines and solos over your own rhythm playing this is a great little unit at a good price. Would definitely purchase it again.
A2CCGGDGZ694CT_B007T8OGLK,"Not too bad This pedal sort of let me down a bit.I really cannot find a musical sounding adjustment,I can hear a small amount of octave when I adjust it but it is mostly a fuzz pedal with a mid range cut switch.If this was more of an octave pedal I would have been entirely more into the way it sounds.I kept it because to be honest it is very cheap.Why bother sending it back? It is a very good paper weight and I have even used it as a hammer and pounded nails in with it.Lets face it,If someone breaks into my house I can whack them on the head with it and knock them out.I just cannot get any octave sounds idk am I missing something? Joyo I like your other pedal but this one makes me want to punch your entire company in the mouth."
A1D086N00QVF8Z_B003GEBGA0,"Great Back Up Mic and Great Value Great value! Using it as a back up stage mic. Sound very good and for the price it can't be beat. It does not quite come up to the standard of our professional mics, but gets the job done when needed."
ATPP3IWN4S9PW_B000VJ2VCK,"Too narrow for me Do you like to shift your booty around on the seat?  You can't with this!  It's too narrow at 17 inches.  I am going with a wider one.  (other than that is seems decent)Updated March 4th, 2014: I ordered the On Stage KT7800 and have had it for several weeks now.  I am much happier with it, and it is easier to adjust.  The first one I ordered was defective and I had to send it back, butt now I am good to go."
A3ITN3125FJETP_B000P5LVSK,"Smooth Jazz Great picks, not just for Jazz though. I play pretty much everything and these work really well for most styles. Takes a little getting used to the smaller size and feel, but once you do they are fantastic."
A35CRCL7WVUCYG_B002AQNGIU,"Custoemr comments This was a filler item for a much larger order.  I am very interested in the Straplocks, so I decided to give them a try.  I sincerely like the concept."
A356YVTEMDX69J_B0002E3CHC,"I wasn't impressed... I like D'Addario strings, but these did not impress me. They are not worth the extra cost, in my opinion."
A1VR0GV8LPJYNF_B003VWKPHC,"Always loved this, this is my second! My old one lasted a long while and it still works. Just wanted another one. These tuners are just awesome!"
A33H0WC9MI8OVW_B0002D0CGW,"Just right for Mountain dulcimers The .6 MM pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks. And the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing. I know people use yogurt containers, credit cards, bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks, but for me, the consistency of the Dunlop pick can't be beaten. And the price is right, too!"
A3BMYEA3J6RBVV_B00CK2FOZM,"Solid capo for lifetime Fit perfect to my Taylor T5 and no cons I can find so far. If you want a capo for guitar, this one is the one stop shopping for you."
A27DR1VO079F1V_B0002PBS6I,Proven strings The string are easy to play and sound great. There is a reason they are used by so many professionals.
AKALIDNS3NMZ7_B0002E1NNC,"Great strings My son plays electric and acoustic guitar. He uses Elixir for both and swears by them. He has had other brands, but they just don't stand up to elixir."
A27PF2GVKMJSAA_B0037M62AK,"Looks great, stays on, but might be a little rough on skin This strap has a fantastic old-school look and vibe, and I've never had it slip off while playing.  The only downside is that it's a bit rough on any loose skin.  I could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up I can feel it on my neck (but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose t-shirt).  For 99% of situations these strap rocks."
AG3PVU7DCXZTK_B00095VIMU,"So glad I listened to recommendations for this product These are a must-have item. Heretofore, I've been using the Planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism. While it's an innovative system that doesn't require any installation, the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things.I installed the Schallers on my Warmoth Strat body -- I found that I needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit -- not a big deal at all. These Schallers are exactly what I wanted. 5 stars, and a no-brainer."
A15WZCSME5X74S_B0002GJ6FC,"Very usefull In the case of you change the guitar strings, or in case you just make a revision setup, this item is very useful, because the guitar will be land and the her body will stay firmly attached."
A12DQZKRKTNF5E_B0002M3OVI,"Stable base and adjustable, just what I wanted Solid construction and well weighted, this stand is perfect for desktop use with height adjustments from 8.5"" to 13"" and a 6"" base; per the measurements given on the box.  The locking die-cast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure.  The color is darker than pictured on Amazon - black powder coating.  There's no tipping or imbalance to worry about with this mic stand, and it's reasonably priced. (* I picked mine up for under ten in the Amazon Warehouse.  It didn't ship with any directions for set-up, which may or may not be the standard packaging.)Do take note that this stand has a US standard 5/8"" top.  I needed a 5/8"" female to 3/8"" male adapter to get my mic to mount to this stand. There are a few on Amazon, but I found the best deal at another retailer online.  These are the adapters that I'm talking about:Windtech Adapter 5/8"" Female Standard Microphone to 3/8"" Male.  You may not need one if your microphone mount ships with one installed, which can be easily screwed out to then expose the 5/8"" space.Overall, I'm very pleased with the fit, finish and construction of this item, and I'm sure it will work very well for my uses. I recommend it to others looking for a stable, sturdy, adjustable desktop microphone stand."
A30J7WQV0ZNRXG_B00IZCSW3M,"The Best I Have Ever Used! These really ARE different and better. I am,  primarily, an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago, a Gibson Les Paul. What I am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars. Most name-brand strings are just fine, but some are markedly different than others. A few are actually a notch-above the others. These NYXLs from D'Addario are definitely in that 'notch above' category.I find them easier to play, better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others I have tried. I plan to stick with them.  A few comments about each area:Playability:These NYXLs bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting (left) hand than do most of the others. Of course I have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent - but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore. These strings seem less 'cutting', even after a couple of hours of constant playing. THey also 'squeak' less when I slide up and down the neck.Sound:The sound is crisp and rich at the same time. Most electric guitarists who I know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly. I prefer a blend of both - just as I do for my acoustic instruments.  These NYXLs provide the closest blend that I have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics, andTuning:Tuning and re-tuning can drive a guitar player to distraction.  Even some really good sounding strings don't hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff, need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone. These NYXLs are holding the tuning FAR better than the others I have used. Less time tuning = more good time playing!All-in-all, I found no flaw in these strings. There is always something new coming along and D'Addario's formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference.  UNtil someone comes up with something better, I expect to stick with them!"
A1GMWTGXW682GB_B001PGXKC8,Good cables for the price. Planet Waves has built its company making affordably priced accessories and these patch cables are no exception. I bought these at a local Guitar Center for about the same price. The thickness and connectors seems to hold up well although I may look for a slimmer alternative soon as some other reviewers have stated also that the connector ends are a bit large and could become difficult to work with in smaller or crowded pedalboards.
A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA_B0052S3WFU,"Consider Your Technique And The Tone You're After These picks are comparable in shape and feel to Grisman's Dawg Picks (and frankly, cheaper). The thickness and rounded bevel will absorb a lot of high end from your tone and, depending on how you play, this may or may not be acceptable.In my opinion, if you play with a relatively free and loose wrist, without anchoring your fingers or palm on the mandolin face or bridge, you'll get a woody, warm tone with plenty of definition and good volume. Varying the horizontal contact point along the strings can bring out a bit more high end. I play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks. (For guitar I prefer a 1 mm traditional tri-corner shape but that's a different review). If, however, you're really a fan of a biting high treble sound, these picks are probably not your best choice unless you're willing to put a sharper edge on the bevel with a file and fine sandpaper. In fact, a pack of 12 three corner picks can be an economic way to experiment with pick shape and bevel angle if you're searching for your ideal tone.If you support your hand by resting your palm or fingers on the mandolin, chances are your attack, tone and volume are generally softer and I think these picks will produce an unacceptably dull tone. Tweaking the shape may still leave you feeling as though you're not benefiting from the large mass of the pick and it's just slowing you down. For such a lighter stroke, I'd recommend the 1 mm tri-corner I use for guitar."
A306YUQBEB2R9T_B0073XCXHA,"Good lil' tuner.. Will work on any instrument.  You don't need the expensive ones, this works just fine..just wish the batteries lasted longer!"
A306YUQBEB2R9T_B0073XCYO2,"Good little tuner I really think it doesn't matter which Snark you buy, they are all set up to measure tuning within any instrument's range.  It was cheap, and affordable.  One of the issues I've had with Snarks is that if you get the one with the vibe and the mic, the mic quits working, and you really only need the vibe anyway, so why pay more?"
AG8FGAIPRBKIR_B0002GYW4C,"Great For Wiping Strings After Use With No ""Fuzzies"" I tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars.  Therefore, after playing, I always wipe down my strings to extend their life.  I've used other microfiber cloths, but they tend to break easy and leave ""fuzzies"" on the strings, which I then have to remove one by one.  This cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use.  It is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use.  I liked my first one so much, that I am putting in another order."
AD4MJT7YYVHP7_B000PO30QM,"Excellent quality, good usability These cables are VERY good. The metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins. There is no play when I plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight- that is, the pin diameter is perfect! There's also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue (which is how I lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice)"
AO68X66YOJGQI_B0018SJLFS,Tungsol 12AX7 preamp tube This is a very quite tube and has all the gain you'd expect from a great 12AX7 tube. If your looking to push a power tube into distortion this little bugger will definately do the trick.
A1T4U9CAQ25IBR_B0002GZ052,A Must Have There is no way any kind of rig is complete without at least one of these.  I have several.  Came in perfect working condition.  Great Buy.
A34QGH6PW5UPA2_B004VDD4KK,"LOVE IT! This may have been the best money I've ever spent for a guitar accessory. I can dial the pressure to exactly what I need for any spot on the neck. It has a smooth action, no ""kerchunk"" noise. My guitar stays in tune when capo-ed. I love it!"
A34LQ791ACZ0JC_B000RY68PA,"Quality Cables For The Money I've used GLS products before and they are good quality for a fair price. Their microphones do a great job for little cost. I've been impressed. These cables didn't disappoint me, either. Don't judge their products on price alone. Try them first. You will be pleased and your bank account will thank you."
AVY8D3ULJTX0H_B0009EQOES,"Solid Strap This was my first strap. It looks good, feels pretty strong, and it is difficult to strap to the guitar. By being difficult, I mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons, and it holds on tight. This makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground. You can't beat the price either!"
A2U7DXDNYBBLQJ_B0018TAITA,Perfect Really great quality item. It was delivered fast and there was no difficulty setting it up. It's durable and I suspect will last me for the rest of my days.
A3OXHLG6DIBRW8_B0002H0A3S,"Good Replacement Strings - Highly Recommended These D'Addario Medium Acoustic Guitar Strings come as individually packaged sets of three, with the necessary six strings in each set. Being new to guitars, we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point.The strings are good quality, produce accurate tones (according to our auto-tuner), and have held up well.Highly RecommendedCFH"
A22Z554ZQ8NFPC_B0002E38AS,"Good cable I've had one of these for about 20 years, have gigged with it extensively, and I've only had to replace it once. (more on that later).I'm not really a cork-sniffer re: guitar tone.  I think most of our tone comes from our fingers, and so the trend in the last several years toward high dollar guitar cables is lost on me.  I think this Monster cable sounds fine.  Better?  Well, better than what?  I don't really notice a difference when I use different cables.  Maybe a slight difference in the high frequencies, but it's so slight as to be negligible.I look for guitar cables that will last.  That's what I really care about, and so far this Monster cable does the trick.  I use other brands, too - this is my most expensive cable but I think it was worth the $40 I spent all those years ago.Oh, and the return process.  This was maybe 10 years ago.  I called Monster, they gave me their address and I had to pay about $3 to ship it back to them.  About 2 weeks later I had a new cable.  I consider that to be excellent customer service."
A94QU4C90B1AX_B000K6B4E0,Pick of Destiny ! I am a big fan of the movie &#34;Tenacious D and the Pick of destiny&#34; so when I saw these picks I just had to get them!

A3RFWANBUVX4RA_B000RYE5Y6,"it's a knock-off, but it works fine Its the exact same thing as my &#34;Shure&#34; mic cable except the metal ends seem like they were made from a cheaper material. thats fine by me. They fit with no wiggle room and transfer phantom power as they should"
A14HVB7CVCYTIY_B0002E3DGC,"Great case, great price! I ordered this for my Jackson DKMG. This is my 1st Gator case, and I'm very pleased with it. It is similar to SKB and fits my guitar very nicely. Being lightweight is a big plus as well, and also the secure feeling of having a HSC. I will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it. Just remember that this model is for standard type axes; Strats, Teles and such."
A2HDEN9SPBWC5I_B000OY707S,Does its job I bought it to use with my Boss ME-70. I use the to go up and down through my banks I have programmed on the ME-70. Build like a tank. Simply to use. Simply to hook up. I hear it can be used on other Boss and Roland gear.
A1UMM894XSEO4F_B0002D05FU,"guitar polish this is the one that everyone told me I should use, being new to guitar I figured one polish (car) has to work well, that was very incorrect on my part, this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes"
A3DOXGBWDJ1MU0_B003DVGVIS,Good picks. These picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick. I use them for playing bass. They work well for that. I have not used them for a regular guitar. I prefer a standard pick for that.
A18VM3LYCTBV3E_B007T8OGLK,Solid little stomp box This pedal provides the classic octave distortion I sought after. For the price and product quality you can't go wrong with this one. And the functionality is great! Use it as a fuzz/distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic Jimi Hendrix like tones and harmonics
AJCHGS1GND4OA_B0002D0DWK,These will save you hide! These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company.
A1XEX009ZR6WXG_B000MVYOZY,"Good Practice Amp It's a nice little amp for practice, it lacks volume and low end for performance.  I have used it for several months with no problems."
A1AYYN6YUIDWVG_B000J5Y282,"Perfect for my studio I was actually trying to buy the smaller Xenyx when I bought this one, but I'm so glad I got this model. Unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it. I use with the UCA202 audio interface and the Audio-Technica AT2035 for recording on my PC with Audacity every day since I unpacked it with no problems. Makes a perfect small studio combination!"
A3VINMY1DIEHL7_B003VWJ2K8,"great parts All the parts I buy an Amazon  have  been checks out before I buy them and they  have been compared with other companies, and I found these parts are the best price and quality compared to other outlets I repair and rebuild guitars as a hobby and I am satisfied with these parts johnJ."
A38HMS5RYSYF8G_B0018TIADQ,It really adds style to my guitar... I used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier. Now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer. It really makes the guitar stand out. It was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it. I recommend this product. Works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time.
A1JCRZEQACX4V4_B0002GZLZQ,"Great value but the description is vague isn't it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description? The product is great value for money and worth while buying, if for no other reason than save money on overpriced DC power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units. Trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit. They don't!! Dumb of them, as all they needed to say  was you needed to buy them separately, which I later did. Seems like nit picking? Well, it's not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me. Sloppy isn't it?"
A2QDVOUXE4PYIM_B002HPMTZU,"get it I got this for Christmas last year ,as a beginner learning guitar ,this is a must have , works really good had mine for a year and it is still working and hadn't had to replace the battery's yet,, and I tune my guitar every time I play,  well worth it,, its so easy to use,"
A2QMNA0ZT6XMRR_B000XPPURU,"The best guitar strap made! For players that want a high quality guitar strap that weighs almost nothing, last forever, stays in place, and has classic good looks there is not a better strap than Levy's natural leather, suede strap (without the piping and stiched edge). The dying of the suede side is deep and flawless and the strap is a quality piece of hide without bulk or unnecessary weight from padding.  Feels great to the touch and you quickly forget that its even touching your shoulder. It can be a little bit of a chore to get strap locks on, but once on I have never had any worries or failures so that my guitars are nick and ding free. Plenty of color choices.  This is a simple, elegant strap that inspires envy.  Planet wave has a nice strap that is the only one I've seen (and owned) that even comes close, but  there is no other suede strap that is even in the same ball park as the Levy MS26.  I own 4 and they are admired by everyone who sees them and slips them over their shoulder.  It could cause you to reconsider use of shoulder straps... It did for me."
A2RIXSMGE9VIBG_B00BTGMI5O,"Great deal for what it is. You can save yourself a separate guitar audio USB box with this amp! Do not expect this to sound like a Fender Frontman with 2 x 12"" speakers. But for practicing in your bedroom or similar it's perfect. Plenty of sound effects to mess around with. Are they as good as dedicated $100 per stomp box effects? Probably not, but so what. Just found out the best part of this amp. You can connect it via the USB port to your PC not only for using the rather cheesy Fender software, but it lets you pipe your guitar's sounds into software like Garage Band. You can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an M-Audio M-Track or similar. PS: It is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the MIC or LINE IN in of your computer (even with the right adapter plugs) as the impedances will not be right. On top of that, I have connected the Mac's headphone audio out to the amp's AUX in! Sounds MUCH better than listening to the PC's normal puny speakers.UPDATE: While the built in USB interface does work, a dedicated device with good pre-amps like the Focusrite 2i2 is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: While I am keeping this amp for convenience I have quickly learned that NOTHING can match a real tube amp. You can simulate all you want (and I am talking much more expensive SW solutions, its like imitation chocolate vs. REAL chocolate. Got the Marshall DSL 40 Watt combo. Amazing sound."
ATB2PLCVQ2XC9_B0009H00WW,"Rajin' Indeed! I installed the Ragin' Cajun into my Fender Super Champ XD.  I read all of the reviews of people saying this speaker turned their Super Champ into a monster and man they were right!  I immediately noticed a difference in the warmth, articulation, and fullness of my sound!  The cleans are warm and...clean, and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely.  I had been trying to play Tool's ""Jambi"" and the beginning part never sounded right.  I always thought I was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned.  Tried the same lick with the Ragin Cajun and it sounds perfect!  I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone that owns a Fender Super Camp XD or needs a 10 inch speaker.Two items of note:  1) A few people said this is a bass heavy speaker and I do not agree.  While it is slightly darker than the stock speaker, it has a screaming Mid/Low range.  A quick turn of the Treble knob from 4 to 6 cleaned up the darkness.  2) Don't forget, the first time you install the speaker will be the worst it will sound.  All speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot.  With that said, this thing sounds amazing directly after install.  Buy, you won't regret!"
A1YP96MT6W9FTB_B000NGVQKO,"Very Good Finger Picks! I decided to try these open metal finger picks when I could no longer find ProPicks, which I really like.  ProPick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar.  Compared with the ProPicks these are manufacturer from a heavier, stiffer metal.  They offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger.  I find these (and the ProPicks, for that matter) much more natural than conventional picks.  These actually have some advantages over the old ProPicks: (1) you get three finger picks, rather than two; and (2) because the metal is a heavy gauge, they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers.  It would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that they're protected in the guitar case; however, they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well free-ranging around in the case.  Highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar."
A1D086N00QVF8Z_B00BU9KCXK,This is the perfect stand! I cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand. I had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over. This one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over. Small and sturdy. I use it at practice and during our live shows. You can't go wrong with this.
A1L2S18BTJE1BZ_B007YWHIP2,"It was a gift A friend gives his time to help kids learn music. .He mentioned the need for one, so Got it. It appeared to be built well and I've not heard any complaints about the performance. Not very helpful sorry!"
A34O0KQV4QXWNQ_B0002E51ZS,"An Essential Compressor That I Prefer Over Boss This is a great pedal to have in your setup, for those times you want a clean sound that will cut through the mix, yet will not just sound blaringly loud and undefined. I used a Boss compression pedal for many years, and the Dyna Comp was definitely a refreshing step in the right direction. It just sounds more organic, and less sterile than the Boss Pedal. I also think in this case, less is more, as far as the controls are concerned."
A3MMISYL1GBXH4_B005FKF1PY,"Surprisingly accurate! I have both this tuner and a Snark for each of my instruments.  Though I am not a professional musician, I find each them to be of equal accuracy.  In fact, the D'Addario's compact size and fit is totally un-noticeable and though its screen is micro in size, it is very clear and viewable denoting flat/sharp notation.  A great choice for the price."
ADOSJR623FDF1_B0002DV7U2,"Great electric guitar stand This stand is designed to work on electric guitars, not acoustic or acoustic/electric guitars.  The arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars.  This is however perfect for my LP and SG guitars.  I love its size and portability."
A3EA7KGYC8LB0_B0002MDTVS,As far as wire music stands go this one is great! but wire music stands are the WORST! Spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier! these can't support heavy stuff and will knock over SO easily. They sure are portable though. not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny!
A3GH47E9FF8WN1_B0002CZVZK,"The Best of the Lot I've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). Over the years, I've tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel, the Martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus."
A1VOONTYYM0SDA_B0002IHFVM,"Good strap. The threads can sometimes come undone slightly and make you itch if they come in contact with skin, but it's still a great strap and holds up solidly. Would certainly buy again."
A27AD1FFGBVFY0_B000VBC5CY,"Great Pedal Board, But With a Couple of Minor Caveats If you are using Electro-Harmonix, Red Witch, Voodoo Labs or the larger MXR pedals, they won't fit in the styrofoam cutouts. You can, though, just take that styrofoam pad out and velcro the effects on to the board.I also have a Morley wah and they have big footprints, so they will take up a good initial chunk of room on the board. If you have a Cry Baby, though, everything should fit a little more comfortably. Right now, I have the Morley sitting outside the board due to the number of pedals I own and that four of them are a little outsized (MXR ten band EQ, EHX Electric Mistress, Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz).There is some hum, but it isn't so pronounced that it interferes that much with your sound.So for all that you get with this and the fact that it cuts down almost totally on the need for adapters (except a DOD Malmsteen preamp overdrive), this is a great deal. Of course, the durability is still in question at this point."
A13T4T3QOSII3I_B003VWKPHC,"Very good and solid I tune by ear and the old fashion way, but this is so much better and locks in the note so you can really tell what you are doing.  Great tuner."
A1F4KCBVDP8S25_B004M9CKVM,"Fantasic Delay I was hell bent of getting an analog delay and the local shop didn't have the one that I was looking for (MXR Carbon Copy), so they recommended that I try out the TC Flashback Digital Delay instead. This is priced comparably to the Carbon Copy, but it has so many more features (I guess that's expected of a digital delay) that I couldn't pass it up.Similar to the other TC product that I purchased (Corona Chorus), this sounds great, it's feature rich, and easy to use.The analog and tape delay modes do a very nice job of emulating the sound I wanted to get from the analog Carbon Copy, but it also has tons of other settings to pull out a digital sound; think exact repeats and a delay of up to 6 seconds. Shorter delays can be had by switching to the slap back mode, which puts this pedal into instant Rock-A-Billy mode.This is tone print enabled, (a feature that I have yet to try, but it seems like a cool concept), has a tap tempo setting and a 40 second looper all in one small delay box.This is the first delay that I've owned and I'm not looking back."
A2Z3IXZ17E88J4_B005GZ86ZA,"Perfect inexpensive wall hanger for a ukulele I'm a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars.  I learned a long time ago that guitar-like instruments ought to  be hung by the neck, as one finds them in a music store, to minimize neck warpage, and all my instruments are hung.  This is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele, but I also thought the instrument would double as wall art.So when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric-acoustic uke from Hawaii, I immediately went shopping for a wall hanger.  There are more expensive ones out there, but this wooden String Swing turned out to be perfect.  Easy to install, holds the uke perfectly, and the whole thing looks great on the wall.  Call me a satisfied customer.JM Tepper"
AMVC9WTXYKNJ1_B0002FO9QY,"Fits like a glove The shell and the lining of the case are perfect: hard on the outside, and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap, and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I'm not traveling around with my guitar too much, so that's not a problem for me, but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise, it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches."
A158NXQZK3SZ9N_B0002D01K4,This case is it. Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed.
ALHC64J88LVWO_B0002H0A3S,"Highly recommended.  Very good strings. I usually play classical (nylon string) guitar, but have an Ovation deep-bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out, I never have found strings that I really liked (don't ask me why I never thought about contacting Ovation and asking them what they use from the factory.  One of those duh things I didn't even think of until just now).Based on reviews and questions answered here on Amazon, I purchased this triple-set of strings.  Instant gratification.  First, they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis (no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days, but these retained tune fairly well).  The sound is excellent, the playability comfy.  The tone of my Ovation was back.Here are my itemized observations:* First, three sets for $13 (currently).  Cannot beat the value for price.* BRILLIANCE.  What many people call &#34;bright&#34;, brilliance is the opposite of &#34;dull&#34;.  Some strings sound dull right out of the package.  These strings are brilliant, bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar.* TONE.  The natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through, no hint of &#34;tinniness&#34;, &#34;plunk&#34; or &#34;twang&#34;.* MELLOW.  Mellow is difficult to define, but the best definition I've heard is, &#34;Ah, that sounds nice.&#34;  Mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar.  It's a pleasantness that doesn't grate on your ears when you pluck a string.  These strings are medium-mellow, just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep.  : )* BALANCE.  At first the E overtoned the b and e.  But as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out.  The trebles became clearly audible while the E and A provided just the right touch of bass.* COMFORT.  The 12-53mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers.  Thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars.  Lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action.  These strings are just right-- especially the 53mm E, which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming.SUMMARY:  These are excellent strings, which doesn't surprise me since I've use D'Addario classical guitar strings for years.  Martin and GHS are both good strings, but somehow D'Addario just shines.Thanks to Amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try.  Highly recommended."
A1XJKAH0QCUVWD_B005A09I7Q,"Nice Product I don't often use a pick for my soprano uke. The Mahalo picks bring a clarity of tone that I really like, especially if I'm looking for a brighter sound."
A26HM2R5529NYY_B0002D0CNA,"Necessary There isn't much to say about this product, except it works as advertised.  If you don't have one of these and you are a live performer, I highly recommend you pony up the few dollars and pick one up (pun intended)."
A1EVEQAR05SY7L_B0002D01K4,Great budget case for Les Paul style guitars. I'm not much for brand names on my guitar cases. I figure it tells would-be thieves what they're getting!  I sprayed a little matte-black paint over the Epiphone logo. The case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush. It fits my Line 6 JTV Variax in a very cozy way. Great case for small cash!
A10FM4ILBIMJJ7_B005PGGU9O,"Great for the money spent. This appears to be a good sturdy capo with a strong spring and a rubber appearing pad on back to protect your guitar neck. It looks fine and works well on the neck to hold down the strings, just as it was designed to do. It looks and fits just as shown in the picture. I recommend it."
AS421KUEDNJ5V_B0026RB0G8,"A Fine Quality Product For A Very Low Price. As soon as put it on my guitar, I enjoyed the way it got the job done. My first concern was, Will this damage my guitar? The answer is NO. It is user friendly and guitar friendly. The price is so low, you should own at least one. No problems. Just music. At the most competitive price available."
A1YR3RVSBZK8CW_B005EHILV4,"it does the job it does the job to do my home made music demos, nothing professional though. im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes."
A1WD8RFNIGRPDH_B0055V7UR0,Cool variety I bought the wrong pack(Was supposed to buy the light/medium pack) but its alright these picks let me try out a bunch of different gauges and materials to see what fit me best. My favorite pick out of this bunch was  the Dunlop Jazz 3 pick. It would be great if the item name was changed to like 'Dunlop 12 Med/Heavy pick variety pack' but that might be me being too picky.
A1W228ES4U9GDQ_B0002GMGYA,"Great cord. Solid, reliable and rocks.Works as expected and should last a really really long time. Glad I bought it. Nothing else to say. Thanks."
A3J7KKG9O7KAZM_B000KIRT38,"Nice Wah My 1st Wah. This is going to take some getting used to regarding the switches, knobs, and buttons.  I am working on getting that nice way sound which I've come across somewhat.  It sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords. One thing I would have like would be to have some more detailed instructions about all of the functions it offers.  Behringer has never been very documentation oriented."
AHF7SNSZPRNCE_B0002GWFEQ,"These things are awesome. I have two of these for my acoustics, and when I get another acoustic...I'll be buying another one of these. Nice quick release without having to tie anything. I have one that is over 5 years old and still works like a charm."
A3HN470MGR70D2_B000CCMWVG,"Cheap But Useable This is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in China.  I bought it to replace the original (chipboard) case for a 1963 Gibson ES-135 archtop.  Lower bout is 16&#34; wide, upper bout is 12&#34; wide, body is 21 &#34; long, and it's about 5&#34; deep at the bridge.  Fits very snugly in this case which is what I was hoping for.  The case is about 4&#34; longer than the top of the headstock but I didn't expect an exact fit.  The wood shell is thin so don't drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases.  Normal plush fake fur inside with about 3/4 of soft foam all around.  Black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay.  This is NOT a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use.  Only annoying thing: the case arrived locked.  The keys were, of course, inside the case.  Dumb.  A friend at a music store used a key from another Guardian case to unlock it.  A good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and NOT to keep crooks out."
A1ZYSJS573OQ5P_B000KIRT6A,"OK for experimentation, but for less noise, go elsewhere if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. Pay the extra money and get something quiet. Others complained about this and they were right. If you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. Some complained about each band boosting others. This is more of a user problem than manufacturing. If you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. In this respect, its like an MXR 6 band."
A3G5BIFX6VS1OP_B0002H0JZC,great strings These strings sound great. I was really impressed by the sound. They stay in tune very nicely. Great for beginners and intermediate players. I would recommend them.
AJH2W783HOXZV_B0002F58TG,"Top of the line guitar I bought this guitar about 2 years ago and I have played tons of different acoustic guitars from Taylor to Fender and more. This is by far the nicest acoustic guitar I have played. The action is very low and the guitar stays in tune very well. I love the chrome tuners and this guitar stays in tune for far longer then any of my other guitars. Additionally, this is my favorite guitar and I would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic. This guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars. The guitar has no finish which I prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands. I love Takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value. This guitar will last forever because it was made so nice. Recommend to anyone whether pro player or armature I promise you won't be disappointed and I have been playing for 6 years so I know what guitar players are looking for in a good guitar. Thanks Takamine!!!!!"
A2RNPVQP4EPGRZ_B001W99HE8,Perfect for the price. Works as well as my friend's condenser mic that cost him three times as much. Great mic for the price.
A19J3XY4IO2OYC_B001PGXKC8,"They slip out Like many say, they do slip out easy so you need to keep that in mind, otherwise for the price and overall quality they are good cables."
AVF06892OWGJU_B004N6RBWW,"What fun. This little Guitarlele is great - I have tuned to the standard E tuning of a guitar and it manages very well. It gives a gently subdued tone, that is perfect for playing any time, even accompanying music on the TV whilst the family are watching. I have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than I had with my twelve string in the last six months.Added info:Now that the tuning has settled down, it is keeping tune very well, with no need to retune during playing.The strings it came with are not the best though, they are wearing through all ready."
A2QMNA0ZT6XMRR_B0002E2GMY,"A clean looking and functional upgrade A great, clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps. The guides on these are not rollers, but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon.  The only guides that I like better are the round 50's guides for Tele's, but then I like those asthetically only on Tele's.  An inexpensive mode that looks and works great.  To the inexperienced eye this simple, clean looking mod can make a Mexican or Chinese instrument look more like the made in America models."
A1FCX548TD6DLP_B005H2007E,"Works Very Well It works very well, installs easily, stays in place once installed but can be removed easily.  Does not scratch guitar's finish (just be careful, and no issues).  It will not produce the sound of a unit that is built into a guitar, but it comes very close.  A great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric."
A1IB42LRNA9QLW_B0002GZM00,"Work great, however... This product works as advertised, but you should beware. These are RIGHT ANGLED, and they WILL NOT fit in a lot of pedals including the CRYBABY WAH.You have been warned!!!"
A12O5B8XNKNBOL_B0002KZE7C,"Great Product! OK, so they are just screws....... but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one!!!  And it is fender licensed!"
AEN6KDJ3AJDK6_B001L8PIFW,"Good little amp For the money, this thing sounds just fine. I got it for my son to toy around with. He barely ever uses it, but the times it's been plugged in, it puts out pretty good sound for the price."
A3OA4DV4L81N1D_B005NACC6M,Great sound and features for the price! nan
A6M441DQ7HL09_B0006NDF8A,"Dangerous for loved guitars I'm another reviewer who has, upon personal inspection, discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar. I returned it.I've &#34;First Act&#34; brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed."
A3GA66OGQOI3EZ_B0009G1E0K,Protec Guitar Strap I have a collection of straps but not a black one.  This one matches the acoustic/electric I bought perfectly.  The pick holder is a nice addition to the strap that none of my other straps have.  I would buy fromthis company again.  Thank You.
A37A41GWQFMK3D_B0002E3DGC,"works great for my strat I bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips.  I check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine.  the it is very good for a Stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner, picks, tuning forks, capo, etc.  and..........the price was very good.  best I could find for this time of hard case.  The only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if I have a gun in case.  If you need basic protection of your guitar, this will do very well.  I do not know if it will fit other guitars.  I have heard that some are too long for it.  but.......for the Fender stat, it works just great."
A29PEU8AQGFQ9X_B0025PM6DM,Just screws that do their job. It's odd to review such a simple thing as screws :-)What can I say? They're shiny and screwed well into the holes.
A2IMZNPSJGB2HQ_B001L8MDMS,"Does what it should I swapped out the pickguard on my American Standard to a black one so I figured I'd change the back plate as well. While nobody really sees the back, it drives me nuts when the front and back don't match. Because I didn't want to go without a back plate, as some people like to do, I picked this one up. The holes lined up perfectly and it literally takes less than a minute to install. You can't go wrong with genuine Fender parts."
A15TYOEWBQYF0X_B009GT0KNI,"very nice replacement for Stratocasters Don't know why quality instruments don't come with bone nuts but these are a very inexpensive improvement.  The next time you change your strings, check and see if your current nut is plastic.  If so, have a few of these on hand and re[place that nut.  You will hear the difference and they don't wear out like plastic.Just make certain you get the height correct so your action isn't too high.  Rule of thumb, grind just a bit at a time and keep checking for correct height.  You can always remove more material but you can't put it back on...This is a quick, easy improvement.  I have bone on all of my guitars."
A2A039TZMZHH9Y_B00004Y2UT,"The Best Cable So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done, still works great!"
ALAY8GVFBUQ9L_B002ZH9JQC,"Great tuner As with all Boss products, I've been very happy. The tuner is easy to use ... need I say more. I'm from the olden days of the 440 tuning fork for tuning, so this is GREAT!"
A3VPJNX40SBP1M_B0002E1G5C,"Good great little time saver with all that is needed to restring in one compact device..It works well, pretty good buy."
A3UXW18DP4WSD6_B007K3EGWI,"worked great need to learn to read, since I have bought two other sets with a wound C string,, so bought these because I was having alot of trouble with my tenor uku my wife bought for me for Xmas,,  have since made a new nut and saddle to fix ( ok bandaid ) a high third fret which also I have sanded down and now is lining up with the others.."
ABJG6JTYTX9M0_B00063678K,Solid! I bought 2 of these as controllers for my Alesis drum machine. One starts/stops the drum pattern and the other triggers the fill and change pattern from A to B. These things stay put and work every time.
AZ0LJNEP2VRD1_B001CJ2QZU,"Great Overdrive Pedal The CM-2 is magnificent: [1] It produces beautiful overdrive (one that doesn't destroy your guitar's tone). [2] It has independent ""High"" and ""Low"" tone controls, and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes--thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation. [3] It features a switch that allows you to pick between ""classic"" overdrive and an extra blast of distortion (""modified""). [4] The case is made of metal. [5] It comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal. This pedal will not give you ""metal"" distortion; for that consider Digitech's TL-2. Instead, it produces a warm, old-time overdriven tone. I love this thing!"
A1YA2BPU7CVNJD_B0002E2XCW,"Great customer service Originally received the wrong item, but I contacted customer service and they returned my email that night (on a Sunday) and said they would ship out the correct product the next morning.  I received the correct item in one day as well as a postage paid envelope to return the incorrect picks.  Great customer service, and love the pics...the color in the pictures doesn't do it justice!"
AM8M5BAQRIXY5_B000AKSUP2,Great pedal at the end of your FX chain This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain. I have it as the last on my pedalboard before my GNX4. It's always on & it only took me about a week to settle on how I liked it adjusted. There are only two knobs & I just played around with them untill I was happy with the sound. I do a lot of recording & I also checked the sound after recording. Can't reccomend it enough especially considering the price.
A1BK0KBZBCB5V8_B0002FO9QY,"Love it! great case for my Epiphone Sheraton II! If you own a dot, sheraton, or a 335, you should buy this case! It comes with a key so you can lock it."
A3PL8ENSYWS1PZ_B0002PBS6I,Excellent Ernie Ball Guitar Strings I bought these nickel wound guitar strings for my son. He says thses strings are strong and durable and projects a good sound quality. I purchase these strings a lot for my son...you can't beat the price for these quality guitar strings. An added plus...they're made in the USA.
A3HMFQWM9Q21SD_B0002ZO3LK,"Another great On Stage utility I use to mount a portable digital recorder onto the side of a mic stand. Very stable clamp mechanism, works very well. Price is good. Nice to have in your gadget bag."
A1V3N0LF1QGG0X_B0002OP7VQ,Handy little Box to have... This is a cool little amp. Sure it's really nothing to write home about but I like being able to take My Strat and just sit somewhere and jam without having to have a Generator to supply the power to conventional Amps. I wouldn't perform with it but great for personal use........
A1RPGT25Q5QSKU_B0002PBS6I,Great Strings! I definitely enjoy these and I highly recommend them! They are used by other artists that approve of them! Slash from Guns n' Roses uses them.
A2DKLC2FJTY9OI_B005CX4GLE,"Great price ad easy to install. Easy install and great price. Shopped these for awhile and had to get all my guitars off the floor, bed, corners of room etc Installed in two minutes. Holds neck lightly - easy up easy down. Padded so does not scratch finish on neck. Will buy again."
A1NAA1R38JSNHV_B0002GXF8Q,"Works amazing! This does a great job blocking out the wind on a microphone and other unwanted noise. I can literally blow into the microphone and you won't get any &#34;pop&#34; in the microphone, only sound waves."
A34LQ791ACZ0JC_B000CZ0RLK,"Great Microphone For the money, this mic performs very well. It is very sensitive, I can hear my computer fans in the background with this mic. If you are going to use it for recording make sure you have a quiet room. I also put a pop filter on it. I've only had it a day, so I'll see how it does in the long run."
AJ03X8Z6RZZ27_B000EEJAWQ,These are okay. A bit invasive and awkward.  I like another brand more because they feel a little more solid..  These feel a bit weak.
A3F1GM7ZAZD1SW_B003U3LUOY,"Foam is foam, but it's still pretty useful. I wasn't sure what to expect, and the foam rubber was a bit of a let down, especially when I took it from the plastic. Very strong fumes, not too pleasant, but they dissipated in the basement overnight.Because of the fumes I was a little concerned about what the material might do to a wood finish.  I was happy to see that there was no apparent smudging or marking after two hours.  I wouldn't leave it on anything ""finished"" for longer than that because this type of foam doesn't last forever and as it breaks down the residue can be hard to remove.  For now, it's great.It comes with a black nylon, sort of mesh tube shaped bag, good for putting it away or traveling.  For now I will just leave it as flat is possible so it doesn't curl so much.  For the size and utility, the price (which goes up and down) seems reasonable."
A3T6OAYYMN3F1Q_B003NJF1G8,They sound great!! They sound pretty good. They tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments.
A2101DHHDMZ93X_B007XH9432,"unbeatable at the price I have yet to install this neck, but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect. There is little to no evidence of corners being cut, just to start. Materials and labor all look good to great. Measuring for fit and specifications is on the money. Not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most &#34;econo necks&#34; seem to be off by at least 1/8.&#34; I'd rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and re-drill. Frets look good, and nut looks good. Until I can install it, I can only really vouch for 4/5 stars.Long story short is this neck looks better than many I've had that cost 2X as much, or more. Unless it has a twist or hump, it actually earns the 5th star. Even if the frets need a little cleanup, it still earns the 5th star. While some may not like the flatter radius, I'd argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they aren't as much of an issue. And it is clearcoated - maybe not a nice amber finish, but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all. So again, another reason for the 5th star."
A6D91KPQGIDKZ_B0009IEB0I,This is simply a great cable. This cable is very well constructed. I use it in my DJ business and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one like it.
AFS3FQR5JSDVJ_B005BSOVRY,"$10 Dream Come True This is a great microphone for 10 bucks, (did I just say $10?....LOL) it does not have the same sound as a Shure SM 57, but it is kind of close. I used it as an overhead microphone on drums, recorded an acoustic guitar with it, and it worked perfect. Seen some reviews about &#34;hiss&#34; from this microphone, the &#34;hiss&#34; is from the cheap XLR into 3/4 connection (who uses that kind of connection anyway?, would have been great if it included a real XLR but cannot complain) after I swapped out the cheap cord and replaced it, hiss was gone, a no brainer really. I have been a producer/engineer for over 3o years, this is a great utility microphone, if you need an overhead, or a microphone to put in front of a guitar amp, slap it on percussion etc... it will work just fine, the sound, it is quite clean actually, for $10 it is a steal. If this one last a few months may pick up a couple more for my studio, as I can never have enough microphones. Every microphone has it uses. I would not recommended putting this up for a vocalist but as a utility microphone you cannot beat price and quality, well constructed pro like product."

A3FW4THIMBIN6V_B00646MZHK,"Subtly Better than Previous Snarks I was hesitant to purchase this, as I really like the display of the previous models. At first it seems like it might be less accurate. It has less granularity in the display for example. However, it does seem to respond noticeably faster. It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes. And it may in fact be more precise, though it takes learning how to work with the display.On earlier Snarks, the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note. And they seemed pretty dead on, especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string. But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune. (Though once you get used to it, it is easily avoided.)Anyway, on this unit, I am not sure what each bar represents, but it is very sensitive. If the string is not quite perfect, the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit up, but so will one next to it. Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on. Then only the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit (unless you turn too far). And the result sounds really right. I think I'll be putting one of these on most instruments from now on."
AFAK8WG4O8INK_B0009H00WW,"Great upgrade! I bought this speaker to replace the stock one in my Fender x2 champ. It has much more weight to it and a way larger, heavier magnet. It has way more bass and is louder than the stock Fender.It sounds much better than the stock one because at the higher volume levels the stock speaker craps out and sounds flubby.  This one solves these issues and sounds great at all levels and settings. Great replacement and a definite upgrade. Makes the champ a SUPER CHAMP."
ASYHYW0USZVN6_B0002M6CVC,Great Item It was a great item. very nice strings. It looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar. Works great
A1M3XD9UV3PD3I_B001R2LQWQ,"Not As Good As BOSS GT-10 The Boss ME-70 is not as nice as the BOSS GT-10 and will not let you install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  I recommend getting a BOSS GT-10 and then install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  Now your guitar can sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg."
A3GJ25QG91UI9Y_B0002GZLZQ,"Visual Sound Visual Sound One Spot Adapter Highly recommend this adapter because it is transformerless and has high current capacity for powering numerous guitar effect pedals. It is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise. Also, it is designed so that it will plug into a power strip without covering adjacent receptacles. Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product."
A1AFN4T80DZ3RR_B0010SHU18,"Easy and unexpensive anti-feedback solution I am impressed how well this works. I was always fighting against feedback during practices and live gigs. This has solved it!It's important to you to know the diameter of your guitar's soundhole. I've tried this with 2 different acoustic electric guitars (Fender CD-60 and Fender Kingman), both of them with 10cm/4in diameter and fits perfectly.I had read all reviews before deciding purchase, and i found people complaining that this is not a good unplugged sound filtering. I should tell you that they are right since this was not made for that. Even when this should affect your guitar lowering you normal sound (unplugged), I would not consider this as a solution for it.If you are having feedback issues due your acoustic electric guitar, without hesitation this one is for you."
A1YR3RVSBZK8CW_B000KITQKM,"freaking awesome!!! thank u behringer!  your pedals really kick ass, this one is outstanding, and for the price can not get a better deal, highly recommended."
A2SRCVYVHA6G19_B000B6DHB2,This is great. I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable. I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small.  There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little.  This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter.  I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone.  It might work in a Busker situation.
ASYHYW0USZVN6_B0044R1M0M,"Not bad at all It wasn't terrible for someone who was a beginner with electric guitars and amp but after a while, it becomes less and less useful."
A3CMSCWXZIVJQ1_B002DC8OE2,"They're not my favorite.....or even close. I've been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them. I figured I'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.These were the first to go on, and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on. The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string. They were twice as loud as these. When you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. They don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. The cons definitely outweigh the pros here.Pros:-Very flexible, string bends are easy-Easy on the fingersCons:-The most dull sound of any strings I've ever heard. Especially on the low end. They're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound. The highs are very tinny. Almost sounds like a bad recording.-Your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. It's the weirdest thing. This is especially true for the G string. It's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. Anyways, it sucks. Grip is the last thing you want on your strings.Bottom line: Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be purchased. I'll never buy again. This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings."
AITXZ1QOILJ5Z_B0042EZH6W,"it didn't work I ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly.  It arrived in a large box and within in the Fender Amp box.  I guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection.  Sadly, when I tried to use them amp, it didn't work!  I checked the wall plug, cord, flicked several switches and knobs but still didn't work.  Needless to say, I sent the amp back to Amazon which was quick and painless.  I wanted an exchange.  I expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me.  But I was shocked to find out that as soon as the return UPS label was recorded at the UPS store, they shipped out another amp.  And it arrived in 4 days since I returned the first one!  WOW!!! That's customer service.The amp is great.  Small footprint, sounds great for what I want it for which is bedroom/basement practice amp.  Does it's job very nicely.  I explored the FUSE software and the potential is almost endless.  Honestly, I don't think I will every fully utilize the full capability of the FUSE software.  I just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there.  I may use someone else's uploaded presets and play with the various options later on.  In summary, 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service."
AVP5CCREISHVX_B000BQTCDO,"It's ok when you get to equalize the tone. It's noisy, but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume, it works fine. I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product."
A3QSZ2SE3HUSXM_B0039HBNMA,Great In October 2009 I ordered a custom Strat and a Bass and the Custom Strat came with these strings. I recommend going with these. The bullet style makes its easier to install. You know what I mean if you are a professional.
A11INIL2YFJ137_B0002E1G5C,"Solid Works well for a multi-tool.  personally you could get away with a little crank winder and a wire cutter, but this is nice to have in your bag just in case.  And for the price you really can't beat it.  3 tools in one handy spot."

ANAOLDUUS8E3G_B002C741BI,"Pickup good lower bad higher volumes This pickup is pretty good at lower volumes. But it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume. The pickup is very, over sensitive.Also, spend some time where exactly you place the pickup, it makes a big difference! Try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something."
AH2F47XZ5L8NR_B003AYC1SM,"Good Bargain for Compressor When I do my reviews, I consider how well does the stompbox do what it does versus the price. I give the MXR Custom Comp five stars because, while it sounds nowhere near as good nor is as easy to use as a Keely, you will pay substantially less. On the other hand, it sounds better than a Boss CS-3 and is more versatile than an MXR Dyna Comp. It is also cheaper than the MXR 76 Vintage Compressor (which has no LED or AC adaptor). So, I think that the MXR Custom Comp is worth considering when shopping for a compressor. You should watch demos on YouTube and many stores sell MXR so you can try one out. If you want an inexpensive compressor with LED, AC adaptor, and a versatile sound palette, then the MXR Custom Comp is pretty good.Anyone who argues that compression does not change your tone has not fully explored the potential of a compressor. If you would like some evidence, consider a song like The Fixx ""One Thing Leads to Another"" which was created in part by cranking a compressor up. The manual gives three settings you might try--""Chicken Pickin',"" ""New Wave Reggae,"" and ""Chime Bloom""--each of which sounds different. The MXR Custom Comp can also give you volume boost if you wish to use it for that function, and I think it does so wayyyyy better than the Boss CS-3 (which seems more apt at volume drop, you have to crank it all the way to get a boost).One problem with this compressor is that there are four control knobs, two on the exterior (Output & Sensitivity) and two in the interior (Attack & Trim). In order to set it as the manual suggests, you will have to open up the case with a screwdriver and turn the two dials inside the box. Because of that, I just set it on ""New Wave Reggae"" (for 80s sounds, funk, etc.) and manipulate the external controls as needed. If I was playing country, I would simply switch it to ""Chicken Pickin'"" and leave it. If you are playing multiple styles, I would seek a different compressor like a 4-knob Keely.A second problem with the MXR Custom Comp is noise. If you crank the Output up, it creates a buzz (in my rig) that can be taken care of with a noise gate. The Dyna Comp does the same thing, but I did not hear that as much on the Keely or Boss CS-3.I find that leaving the compressor on all the time sharpens my tone without taking it over, but at the same time I can easily vary the Sensitivity to get different tone/sustain. It can give an awful lot of bell-like sustain on clean sounds and works great with a chorus pedal.BOTTOM LINE:(1) Nice compressor for the price, especially if you want versatile sound palette, good volume boost(2) Hard to work with due to interior controls (dumb!)(3) Generates noisy signal when cranked(4) Gives sound like MXR 76 Vintage Comp with less cost, plus on/off LED & AC adaptor at cheaper price(5) Good compressor in its price range (Keely is far superior in sound but you pay for it!)(6) OK paint job, doesn't really catch my eye"
A1ARFA1NCN34UV_B0002CZR3G,"Best tremolo pedal for the money I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal. Does everything it is supposed to do without the ""perceived"" (that's was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals. If it's perceived, then how do you explain how good this sounds? I have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because I was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off."
A34O0KQV4QXWNQ_B0002E1H9W,"The Perfect All-In-One Kit For Your Guitar Unfortunately, the first one of these I ordered from Amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place.

This kit literally has everything you will need (except new strings of course...) to keep your guitar looking and sounding great."
A27V6PS7Y83OIV_B0040O49OU,"Stick with the strap. I ordered this strap to use with both my concert & tenor ukes.  It just works.I already owned a ukulele leash-type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke's sound hole or tie it off to the head. The problem, of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body (sometimes disastrously).  With a strap like this one, you can completely let go of your uke & it stays perfectly in place. Chord changes & strumming become easier when you don't have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck.This is a nice size strap, not to wide not to narrow.  The length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke (and uke player) sizes. It does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke. The other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way. In my case I installed two buttons - more convenient and the strap doesn't interfere with my chord-hand. Here are the buttons I used:Strap ButtonsIf the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant, put your fears aside. It can be done quickly & easily and the end result is well worth it. Here's an entertaining how-to video that will walk you through it: (...)"
A3B4L653KYTW55_B001PGXKC8,Great quality. I figured I would splurge and buy these just to have some backup cables when I wear out the cheap guitar center ones (and have some that match). They are well built and feel like they can take some abuse. I will probably but 2 more packs shortly to switch out all my cables.
A2FFJCRIYMCVCZ_B004TE5HBU,"Amateur Musicians, Record your mix! This is probably obvious to more experienced musicians, but for Amateur musicians (like me), If you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play, then you're fooling yourself.  You have to listen to your mix by recording it, then listening while you're not playing/singing."
A19WXFFQMKES6O_B0002H0LQO,"An improvement I wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin. These will work for soprano. The J53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks. They provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play. Increases projection and tone to any stock strings. Not the best, not the worse strings, but an improvement."
A3L51MT8QKSULJ_B005M0CK9M,"Great Pedal I have heard good things regarding this pedal so I was always interested, but never pulled the trigger on purchasing it.

A2WA8TDCTGUADI_B005NACC6M,"EXCELLENT recorder I bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project.  I can say that it worked amazingly well for this and did an excellent job at recording the bands without any distortion or excessive noise.  The recorder stores two files at the same time, one being a file at your chosen sensitivity and another safety track at a lower level in case there are any clipping issues with your main recording.  This accounts for quick transients or anything that might cause the recorder to overload and ensures that you will get a good take.The microphones can be folded out to extend the stereo field or in to tighten the field.  In addition, you can use external microphones or XLR inputs for professional-level input from the soundboard.  I found that the internal microphones did a wonderful job of reproducing the audience experience and I can't say enough good things about the performance.  This is an absolutely wonderful recorder.Bottom line: Highly recommended"
A1TYYT15KT9TDQ_B000ULAP4U,"I Can hear things with these, that I can't with others. If your goal is to use these for mixing, then just hit the buy button.I have about 6 sets of various headphones from low end to nice gamer phones, and these will allow you to hear sounds that your other phones will not.I use these to mix down multi-track audio and then compare the final mix with a set of regular monitors."
A1WJVU9KICHFI_B00AZUAORE,"a great value I bought this hoping it would be a no-frills looper and that's what I got.  It sounds great and the level adjustment works really well.  I can layer even as many as 10 or 12 layers and hear every one without problem.  I give this five stars, but I have two minor quibbles that in my mind don't take away from the rating but might be important to some:1) there is no included power supply.  If it doesn't take batteries, that's fine, but give me an adapter.  This thing was over a hundred dollars. Don't force me to buy an accessory just to power it up.2) Personally I wish there was an option to remove layers in the order they were added (not just removing the last layer, or all the layers).  I'd like to be able to build up a song with layer on top of layer- moving to a crescendo - and then back off the layers one at a time, eventually returning to a single layer.  I played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it.  I started with one part, and then added layer after layer until I had a really big intricate sound.  It would have been nice to be able to then take it back down to a single part and then quietly end the song.This is a wonderful little looper.  You won't be disappointed."
A1K582XYLTKUCD_B001PGXHX0,Great for metal this picks are great for hard rock since they are heavey but not that heavy for solos. I play a lot of metallica songs with it an they are great.
A35QR07ZW63T65_B004XNK7AI,Bought 6 at once for 6$ They still work years later.  I've had to change a few batteries but they last a long time.  Fabulous tuner.  Even works on a stand-up bass.  Just clip it onto the bridge.  Excellent product.
A3775OP5VTX5ON_B0009K9MUA,"Owned at least four of these. Used these for years on son's electric guitars. No fuss. Mechanics do not seems to wear out, still gripping. No way at all to knock the guitar off the wall. No neck damage to axes. Mounts well, but try to find a stud, certainly. Keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall.No complaints. If you're going to drill your wall, is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers. All 5 star reviews on this baby. And I agree, and I add to that total.  5 stars"
A30KA8I5AHSKJZ_B0016ML1C2,Nice delay For the price of these I am very happy with the purchase.  I feel it sounds really good and has many settings.  I think the build on these are fine for daily use.  Don't expect it to break anytime soon anyway.

A2SFO875EQ66AB_B0002H0LQO,Strings sound great Bought these strings as a replacement to ones that came with my ukulele (the originals only lasted a week).  These D'Addario's have worn quite well and still sound excellent.  Great strings!
A2F26OVBDC7WWA_B003VWJ2K8,"great tuner!! i love this tuner so much! the only reason that i had to buy it a second time was because i lost my first one unfortunately at a music camp a few years back. it works so well though, and i knew i'd have to buy a second one since i'd never see the first one again."
A38DCVO9SZHW68_B0002OOMW6,works I've had an old beginner Ukulele sitting in a closet for years.  I have much nicer ones now and decided that rather than lend them out for playing I'd fix up this beginner uke as a loaner.  I took off the strings and realized how dull and dry looking the fret board had become.  I used this product and it really soaked it up fast.  Now it looks beautiful again.  Very satisfied with how it worked.
A1T9A8YD2FU9UF_B000A2HDXA,"Good sounding inexpensive harps and great case Im a beginner. Good harps. Good solid sound.I cant bend at all so no idea if its just me.Youtube these, there's loads of videos."
A1NMFQP9ZR23AH_B0002KYXTM,"Solid, and does the job, but watch out for polarity! This pedal is solidly built, and works as advertised.  If you're using it strictly as a volume pedal, it does the job nicely.The only problem with it is when you use it as an expression pedal -- it has no polarity switch for expression output.Plugged into some gear as an expression pedal (my Digitech RP55, for example), the down position is muted and the up position is full volume (the opposite of where it should be), and wah effects are backwards as well.  There's no way to correct this without making your own crossover cable (which requires destroying a perfectly good patch cable)."
A3KZEGBTPH6MMF_B005MR6IHK,"Gets the job done! This is my first electric tuner.  As a percussionist-turned-bass-player, I goofed off, stick twirled and snored through countless hours of tuning in band class over the years. Not surprisingly, I kind of laughed at my own peril when it came time to tune my new instrument.  I grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed.  It does the trick.  It's small, accurate enough to get by with general practice (I can correct minor tuning issues by ear).  However, now that I have been using it for a few months, I have noticed that it does not give a very stable reading of pitch.  For example, if I go through and tune all the strings it will read a hair high/low on the next pass, and yet again on a third pass... If you need something &#34;no-fuss&#34; and accurate the first time around to the spot, you might want to invest in something a little more robust.  But, for standard/practice tuning, this is a fine accessory"
A1MAQQXJZTMSKT_B0002E1G5C,"Works well. It works well for guitars and basses, so long as they are the clover style. Other then that it works just like it says it will."
A1K3NQAO49LXL2_B000P5LVSK,"Great pick with a nice tight grip, excellent strumming - a bit small, though, about as big as a nickel A very nice pick, both in feel and texture (the design is a bit boring, though). Only complaint is that it's fairly small - about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece, where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece. But that's okay. I got this the same time as I got a set of Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks and the Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks, and I think I like the Dava picks the best. All three are &#34;tight grip&#34; picks, and all the same size - they're all good, though - I'd rate this one next-best, and the Jazz III Carbon Fiber next after that)."
A3MTR7P9PYAALX_B0002D05FU,"Great for cleaning acoustics! I got this to clean my Washburn acoustic guitar, and it worked great. I used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime, and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft, lint-free rag, and it would act like a polish. The finish sparkled afterwards, even in the light. Great product."

ASJAKT8DJIAC5_B0002CZTIO,"great for my lap steel guitar! I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked, but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them, between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut, works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly, the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). But otherwise, worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!)."
A1YIGDWVHNNTMU_B005PGGU9O,"good capo Great deal on a capo, it's about the same quality as one i would buy for 5x the amount elsewhere.  It takes a while for the shipping, but that's stated in the description.  I was pleasantly suprised.  I would recommend this capo."
A342XAA3YXGKT9_B00646MZHK,"Great price, works well, always breaks within a few months. I will keep my review short as there have been MANY factual and well written reviews for the various Snark tuners over the years.  Quickly though, I will start by also agreeing that for the price, it is hard to beat.  This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one.  It is accurate, reliable for tuning, and affordable.  All that said, here is why I decided to write a review.  I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 3-4 months use.  The unit itself is great.  Here is the problem.  Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short.  Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky.  However, if you travel with it, take it on or off a few guitars a day, or frequently adjust it, it will likely eventually break.  Either the ""rubber feet"" that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuner's head to the clip part will break.  Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars.  One for the electric, one for the acoustic, etc.  This item does not travel well and is best used at home gently."
A2YQTEPCGZ5N7J_B0002CZVXM,"Easy to install, does the job Very easy to install, rock solid, and in my opinion, look much better than Schaller locks.Grab a set, you wont be disappointed."

A24Z0TLWP8FXGV_B000Y30NAA,Don't bother First Behringer pedal I have returned. Almost no effect provided by pedal. I have returned the unit. Not worth it. Lousy pedal.
A2PN3GY7I3EKC1_B000EEHCUS,"Strings is strings....  no, not really. Guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic.  And I'm sure that brand loyalty has as much to do with our perception of that tone as any other ingredient.  Even so, D'Addario has provided a consistent product for more years than I'll readily admit to knowing. I've used may other brands, but I seem to always return to D'Addario for all my steel stringed acoustic guitars."
A1JNV4K56GG94R_B004M9CKVM,"Perfect! If you love delay and want variety, this is your pedal.  I run two amps when I play (often) and the ping pong is delightful for me.  However, in the studio, this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options.  Being Toneprint enabled is a 100% plus.  Very clean, quiet, and durable.  Excellence!"
AKAVVQMXSAIGX_B000KIPT30,"Great deal for the money! I've owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw.  The pots all still work without adding noise, and in general the device does exactly what I need it to do.  You won't find a better deal than this on a basic headphone amp/mixer."
A1TLMSOE1VRDZI_B000EELFTW,"It works - but only one pivot point and I am inexperienced I wish there was a fine pivot/angle adjustment to orient harp to mouth. I feel I have to angle my head awkwardly to use harmonica no matter how I set it up. I have a big neck and a prominent jaw so the armature does not extend as far as I think I need it to - causing the position of harmonica angle to be awkward for me. for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth ( LOL ).This is the least expensive holder I could find Nov 2013. Since it was inexpensive comparatively I will use a vice and bend it to suit me if my grand nephews don't want it.Also not sure why they don't make these wider to accommodate a larger variety of Harmonicas as it has a very strong spring action holding harmonica in place, could easily hold a much larger and longer harmonica if designed to do so. a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design."
A20TFY5J3WNJU2_B0002GJ3ZA,Excellent Stable and precise pick attack. Excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player. I am buying more gauges too. They last forever.
A2A039TZMZHH9Y_B004UNL1P6,Fun Fun Fun This is a cool gadget.  I love experimenting with adjusting the power level on various pedals.  It can do some strange things and get unique sounds.
A1EW1P6BB16GP6_B0002D0CKI,to big another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.
A1ZGNCN1VRUO1H_B003VYBNLW,"Great cable for home practice use this a great cable for practicing at home. Coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles. This product measures approx. 28"" coiled, plug end to plug end. Thus it is pretty short, even when stretched out. For me, it is the perfect length for at-home use, especially when using two (amp --> pedal board --> guitar).not sure why it isnt available for order on Amazon anymore ... I just ordered mine two weeks ago."
A15TYOEWBQYF0X_B005PNXT6E,"very nice cable This amp cable is perfect.  It fits my need for practicing.  It's just the right length for sitting on the couch, strumming daily.  I would like this one for each amp I own so I'm not always taking it from amp to amp.  I will buy some more of these.The cable also looks nice and completes the Fender look.  I would highly recommend this and give it a no-brainer 5 star rating.  I have nothing negative to say about this."
A2VH0UT5EQFB6P_B004N6RBWW,"Classical Guitar Instructor's Review - LOVE IT!!! I bought my Yamaha guitarlele about 2 years ago from Long & McQuade located in Canada.  It's the same as the one Amazon is selling here.  I teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele.  My reason for buying this is because I don't have to learn how to play the ukulele and can play the guitarlele using the knowledge I already have - yea!It is very similar to a guitar in many important ways.  It has the same 6 strings tuned the same way.  However, and this is VERY important so please read carefully:  To get the best sound out of your new guitarlele you must tune each string up in pitch.  For example, let's take the 6th string (lowest) and tune it up to A instead of E.  Clip on your electronic guitar tuner and crank that string up a bit until the tuner reads ""A"".  It will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar.So here's the breakdown on tuning each string:6th = A5th = D4th = G3rd = C2nd = E1st = AYou really need to to tune it this way because otherwise the strings are too floppy and you won't get that beautiful ukulele voice.  The action is very good and it will not be any harder to play.The instrument overall is fairly easy to play, especially in the lower positions.  I have trouble holding it because I'm used to holding a classical guitar so I always have to make adjustments to get used to it.  Barring chords especially higher up the neck is kind of tough because the frets are so close together so I usually play easier stuff.  Also, I have discovered that certain types of music really play well and others aren't so good.  Almost all Celtic music sounds great!  Christmas carols are lovely, but Spanish stuff doesn't sound so great, imho.  The instrument just doesn't have enough power to carry some types of music.  Blues are good, and very ancient sounding tunes like those that would have been played on a 4 course guitar from back around the 15th century sound really cool on the guitarlele.  It seems to be well constructed, the tuning gears work well, the action is good, frets are inserted straight and level so I really can't find anything to complain about, especially for the price.I would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun!  It's just like a little guitar with all the same strings and same number of frets. You will probably have to tie a strap on it to hold it in place but that's not absolutely necessary, especially for those of you who are accustomed to playing small stringed instruments.I took it camping over the summer and had a great time playing it around the campfire in the evenings, something I've always wanted to do!  I'm quite fond of my guitarlele and am going to purchase another for my daughter so that we can play duets together on them!  :DUPDATE 4.10.13-------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought another guitarlele (this time from Amazon) and it is exactly like the one I purchased a few years ago.  This one is for my daughter and she is having a delightful time playing it.  We've been playing guitarlele duets together and they sound great and is such a fun thing to do!"
A18DTTRCYR8TD7_B0002F7IIK,Works and looks great! I love these things. They hold your guitars in place and make this storage solution a nice decoration in the process!
AG8FGAIPRBKIR_B002GYWBJ6,"Blown Away I had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing.  Ultimately, my search was narrowed down to this Spider and a Fender Mustang.  After reading many Amazon reviews, I ultimately chose the Spider over the Fender because (i) I read that the Fender amps gave off a hissing noise, particularly with the clean channels, and (ii) the Spider had better rock/metal tones, which is one genre I play, among others.  Regarding the sound, it is unbelievable!  And, to be quite honest, I've only been using the presets!  The cleans are ultra clear, and the rock tones are amazing.  And, this thing is LOUD.  In conducting some internet research, having a mega-watted amp is not necessary and is, in fact, not recommended.  I discovered that the reason for this is because the ""sweet spot"" for the volume is going to be when the amp is about three-quarters of the way up.  In home practice, unless you aren't married and live in the boonies, you won't get there.  With live play, this could hold it's own and in the sweet spot.  As another reviewer mentioned, if you need something louder because you're in a larger venue, the amp will be mic'd anyway.One note...Line 6 does somewhat force you to purchase one of the pedals because you need the pedal to update the amp.  I purchased theLine 6 FBV Express MkII 4-button Foot Controller, and I'm very happy with it.  I like the larger foot pedal switches on this 4-pedal switch, rather than the small buttons on the model up from that (a 6 button pedal board).Finally, I chose this Spider IV over the Spider IV 120 amp version, in part, because this Spider has a larger speaker (a 12"") and the other Spider IV 120 watt model has two 10"" speakers.  I feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones."
A3MONHA5DCPPLZ_B000OR2QX8,"Good thump, responsive smooth. These replaced the ETB92 nylon tapewounds I tried. I didn't realize how much low end I was missing until I put these on. Very nice."
A3KZ3Y88P6CAMA_B0027V760M,"Good Quality Seem to work well. Keep the ground switch selected, and it will do just fine. I have used different direct boxes and I recommend this one."
A3KZ3Y88P6CAMA_B000ARH3M6,"Absolutely Great I have always loved Hercules products. Their mic stands and guitar stands. They are great quality and very handy, especially this one, for performances where 3 guitars are used."
AUH2DKYUU7KC9_B005CX4GLE,"Great hook for the money I have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio. However, I wanted to add a few to our rehearsal space but didn't want to spend a lot. These did the trick fine. They are perfect to rest your axe for a bit without a guitar stand getting in your way. Especially for the price. Okay, they are not high end, but I didn't need high end ones."
A15TYOEWBQYF0X_B0002KZE7C,"fantastic I bought these because I am constantly loosing screws when I change pickguards or do new builds.These are exactly what the doctor ordered.  Original equipment so they're the right screws,  A must have for every guitarist, no matter what brand you own as they work on everything.These are well made and don't strip when screwing in for the first time.  If it's a new project, always drill pilot holes anyway.  I am so glad I bought these, one by one they are being used...almost time to order another set.I store them in a little sandwich bag.  5 stars"
A3SS4Y0BDSPDB0_B0002D0HY4,A Great Low-Cost Mic I got these mics because I am in an environment where we needed the ON/OFF toggle on the microphone and - for us - it works great. These mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room. They sound similar to the Shure SM58 and we use them every day. They are still going strong.
A1RPTVW5VEOSI_B0002FO9QY,"Nice case As a lot of Epiphone owners have learned, cases designed for the Gibson ES-335 clones won't fit Epiphone guitars, as the Epiphones have a slightly larger headstock. This case, however, fits my Dot Custom like a glove. The padding is perfect, the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar, and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level."
A3M9FH2OZKYF4D_B0002GXZK4,"Terrific guitar! I hadn't played guitar in a number of years and decided to get back into it. Having had carpal tunnel surgery a few months ago, and having small hands to begin with, I started researching guitars with narrow necks. The Jasmine by Takamine kept coming up and had really good reviews, so I decided to give it a try, buying the S34C. Firstly, it was delivered promptly as requested, and arrived in pristine condition, with some really nice strings. It has a lovely honey gold finish on the front of the body, which had attracted me to the guitar in the first place. I really appreciate the cutaway. How many high notes will I be hitting on this baby? Who knows, but it looks WAY cool, LOL! The craftsmanship, at least to my unpracticed eyes, looks superb. I wasn't too crazy about the pickguard with all the lettering on it, but finally figured out the lettering was just a sticker that could be easily removed. And the sound...just lovely, with that ringing tonality one would expect from a steel string guitar, but with some lovely mellow tones where needed as well. I am so jazzed about how wonderful this guitar is, I'm taking online video lessons and learning a storm of chords and fingering techniques! Hey, I don't expect to be a Leo Kottke or Martin Simpson anytime soon, but I've got something to shoot for, and we all need a dream! If you're looking for a great guitar at a very reasonable price, look no further. Oh, the reason why I only gave it four stars is cuz the neck really doesn't seem to be all that narrow after all. But, maybe it's just my small kid-like hands. Thumb to little finger, I can barely reach an octave on piano. And there ya go!"
A30VX06O5GPY13_B005MR6IHK,Fender Clipon Chrome Tuner I received the Fender Clipon Chrome Tuner in a very short time.  I know it will live up to the Finder name.  Very easy to use.

ADH0O8UVJOT10_B0002CZVBE,"A versatile, overlooked classic overdrive from BOSS I held out from trying the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive for many years.  Like many guitarists, my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS-1, which was durable and aggressive, but also extremely frustrating.  I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss, when it was probably unfair to do so.The SD-1 is widely owned and very affordable (usually around $50).  It's similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer, except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much.  A lot of guitarists consider the SD-1 to be more of a ""rock"" overdrive, while the TS-9 is more of a ""tube/blues"" effect.  There's probably some truth to that, but both of them are excellent pedals.However, the SD-1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility.  You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel.  But that isn't necessarily the best use for the pedal - it excels as a ""booster"" pushing an already overdrive amp, or stacking with other distortion/OD pedals.  One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down.  This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone, and really sounds great.A feel that lot of people give the SD-1 mediocre reviews for reasons that aren't fair.  You hear things like ""it cuts out too much bass"", when that's really what the pedal is supposed to do.  The midrange hump, when set up properly, can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing.  And, like I said before, I feel as if it's MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS-9, though preference between the two is entirely subjective.But you also know that it's a Boss pedal, which means it's as durable as they come.  The thing will stand up to years of abuse, and can be used in any number of roles.  If you're looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound ""big"", there are probably better options in this range.  (Try the under-appreciated MD-2 Mega Distortion, or the excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive).  But if you understand what this pedal is supposed to do and use it for that purpose, you'll understand why this thing has been popular for over 30 years."
A1A15ECLHM9BQY_B005FKF1PY,"Not as good as mini tuner I tried this after I lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner. Not sure if I lost it at a gig, or my three-year-old son got his hands on it, I'd bet the latter.This micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini, which is nice. That's about the only Pro. There are a few other features I guess, like being able to select the instrument used, but I don't need that.Cons: The readout is smaller, duh, but does not seem to be as bright. I play a lot of outdoor weddings, in bright sun, and this one is much harder to read than the mini.This micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini. As you move closer to In tune, the bars do not smoothly move towards the center, so it's easy to over or under tune, and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done. And those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you're trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect. I'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible, so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option.Does it get the job done? Yes. But there is a product that's almost the same size that works a little better, for a negligible price difference. It might even be cheaper. If you're a beginner and want to select the instrument you're tuning and a few extra seconds isn't an issue, or you play in dark environments and don't need a super bright readout, this will be fine, but I will be going with the mini when I buy a new one."
A21VM9WVF8EOSJ_B001EW5YQS,"A tad bit noisy and cheaply made Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid, it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall, I can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. Still, it's an OK product."
A27KQGXAU8Z7OT_B0042EZH6W,Variety and customizable. Takes you hours to play around with all the sounds. Built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage. Nice and loud in a small package.
A3RDS0DJ5EJGA7_B0002E1O3G,"Lasts a really long time I haven't owned my electric guitar for over a year, but I've only replaced its strings once. I've been playing almost every day for an hour or two and it still looks and feels very new. At this rate, it seems that the current strings I have installed would last forever. Would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set."
A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y_B001J1SX94,"Perfect patch cable My Instant Order Update notice shows that I purchased this in December 3, 2010, and during the time I've owned this cable it has been heavily used and is still noise-free and perfect in all respects.  For context I purchased it to connect a mic tube pre-amp to a mixer, so it has been set up and torn down many times in the past two and a half years.Key points that earn the five stars is the heavy duty strain reliefs, which keep the inside conductors from bending and stressing. I am guessing those are why this patch continues to be noise free and provide a strong signal.  Also, the XLR connectors are of the highest quality. In the past I have cut corners only to find that small details like connectors do not always mate well. Not so with these. They engage and disengage without binding or looseness. Bear in mind that they have been in frequent use - inserted and removed hundreds of times.The outer jacket is fairly thick, which to me is an indication that the manufacturer did not cut corners when this cable was constructed.Overall I am pleased because this patch has withstood a lot of use and has held up perfectly. I would not hesitate to purchase more of this brand and model if I need additional ones."
AEUG4DYQZJ64Z_B0002GXZK4,High Action. Inadequate Loudness for picking As title says:1) High Action2) Inadequate Loudness for pickingI compared this to the Mitchell MD100 and think the Mitchell is very good for it's price.You can compare both at guitar center.
A1MU6PI3YDK8H0_B000EELBQ4,"Good product, good price There aren't enough uke straps out there for a good price.  This one is great.  I take away one star because the padded part could be a bit smaller, lighter."
A1ARFA1NCN34UV_B0002KZDN2,quick fix I was messing around with the wiring in a MIM strat and I ended up melting the switch. So I ordered this one to replace it. Worked out perfect.
A20OBCQWBKCGZT_B00IZCSW3M,"Great company, always great strings I've used D'Addario strings for years and they never fail me. These extra light are great for playing lead as they're easy to bend and feel great on your fingers. As they are extra light strings, they serve limited purposes but as for tone quality it is very smooth and clear. For a brand as a whole i'd recommend D'Addario strings to any guitarist and for gauge it's really dependent on play-style and role if you are in a group."
A3A3ZCWP7Z4V4K_B002AQNGIU,"I like the Original Schallers better yet they are good They seem the same but the original schallers that came with my tele deluxe 2008 are bigger and stronger for the lack of a better word, still a good buy"

A1HW9DAJBYXGDV_B000CCJP4I,"Great value, good pedal Gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings.(Think Alice in chains, or REALLY distorted live nirvana solo) admittedly not everyone's into the whole grunge tone. But it was what I was looking for.Has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too.And hey, you can pretty much get it for pocket change."
AMY8AUDIBXHCI_B000KIPD5E,"german engineering in a china box Not expensive. Not cheap. Not exactly what I wanted.Like most all of the Behringer items it has good points and ""duh"" points.If you use it as an  A/B one input to 2 outs, then you can use the 2 volume controls.  I did not need it for that.If you use it as 2 inputs and 1 out, you only control the sum out, not the individual inputs (thought you could, which is why I bought it. the 1/2 page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can, but you can not.... I almost sent them back.. I bought 2 for a special set up needing to adjust the 2 input levels that I was switching).the LED indicators when using it as a 2 in - 1 out  (like 2 guitars into one amp, or in my case a mando and a midi-guitar rig into a single line in ) ...  are ...exactly backwards...  the one on the right (red) is actually the input on the left and the one on the left ( green) is the input on the right.... which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurant.Operation wise, no hums, no buzzes but no one left on bass.When it is all said and done, I am glad I kept them.Amazon rocks. got them in 3 days. free shipping.  where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar, get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys.  who said Santa was a scrouge.  i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket."
A37A41GWQFMK3D_B006X735PQ,"works great.  why buy the more expensive ones?? this tuner works great.  it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning.  I use mine all the time between different alternative tunings.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my grandson who is learning to play guitar as well.  a great investment unless you have a perfect ear."
AXWI0P2EGDEQT_B0002CZSJO,"The way a cap should be... Quick to clip on and off. Really... Is there anything else to say? What else do you want it to do?These suckers are wonderfully reliable.I've had one for about 10 years. The only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the ""bottom"" of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect. However, for a $1, keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them. Can you go wrong? NO!Great product!"
A2T8JRVJRVNX8R_B0002GJ6FC,"Best overall value This headstand works like a charm. It's simple, portable, and sturdy. P.s. to the people complaining about it falling over...I have no idea what you're doing with your guitars, but mine is very stable. Plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and I've used just about every brand. For the price, you can't complain."
A2F92AOWTIUIB_B006H5119Q,"4.5 stars. Upgrade the bridge. I have spent a good month with my new guitar, and I am impressed. The pickups don't suck, the potentiometers are surprisingly good, the tuners are not very good, but I can live with them. The fretwork was second to none, absolutely the best fretwork I've seen in a guitar under $500. The 60's neck profile is very fast and comfortable, and it's a satin finished neck and body (unfinished fretboard). It's also not a very heavy guitar (considering that it's a mahogany body and neck). My main issue with this guitar is that the wraparound bridge/tailpiece breaks wound strings easily. I have gone through 4 6th, and 2 5th strings in the single month I have owned this guitar. Upgrade it to something better. Your strings will thank you. Oh, and (this goes without saying) UPGRADE THE STOCK STRINGS!"
A2E4JXFRLSUX53_B0014IEBM0,"Worked great for 14 months These speakers worked great for 14 months. Last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working.  It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews. I took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. I contacted M-Audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. One on the East coast and one on be west coast. I've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site. M-Audio doesn't stand behind their products, and I'll never purchase anything from them again."
A1CL807EOUPVP1_B001SC4I16,"This is a toy...not a real instrument. I should have researched this a little bit more. It was a gift for a child, but a child couldn't tune this thing nor could I! It was a toy, not an instrument."
A30KA8I5AHSKJZ_B003VWKPHC,Great tuner I can't believe what you can get for the price on this one.  Tunes all my instruments fast and easy.  The display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever.
A27H0T39U3FZB5_B00IZCSW3M,"Nice bright sound with easy action These have a nice bright sound and are easy on the fingers with a light action. Pretty deluxe strings for the price here on Amazon. I have them on my travel acoustic six string (Martin) and am happy, especially since I am not a &#34;pro&#34; guitarist and my fingers can get sore.I say, get 'em!"
AJBBU53A0X84I_B0002GZM00,"This is a handy piece of equipment. I bought an extension for it, and so this plug has allowed me to stop using eight batteries. Hard not to like that."
ANU2BFZ9STYXU_B0002F7K7Y,Nice cheap strings Obviously these aren't top of the line strings but I used them to record a track in drop C and it sounded awesome. After about a week they started losing tone and started collecting skin.D'addario is awesome if you keep in mind that they're on the cheaper side.

A1MVH1WLYDHZ49_B000068O1N,GOOD INSERT CABLE Another quality product from Hosa.  Just what I needed for an insert patch from my mixer to EQ.  I always like slightly longer length as I can always zip tie back but hard to stretch!  No noise from this cable!
A2FFJCRIYMCVCZ_B000OY4WA6,"A lot of sound for the size. I use two of these as L/R channels, and my Fishman Soloamp as a center channel.  I use a Rode NT4 stereo mic, run everything through my Mackie mixer, adding some reverb and delay (delay a little of the left, send to right channel, and vice versa), and it sounds fantastic (way better than with just the Fishman alone).  Another tip:  Get a copy of Yamaha's Sound Reinforcement Handbook... when it comes to audio, there are so many aspects that all effect each other, so you really need a good technical understanding of it, otherwise you could randomly mess around with everything forever just to get an ""ok"" sound."
A10FM4ILBIMJJ7_B0002E1G5C,"A handy gadget to have arround. I used this a couple of days ago to change strings on my electric guitar (Fender Strat). I was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked. The end that turns the machine tuners is a little loose feeling but it still works well, you just have to be a little carful about not allowing it to slip and to not over tighten the strings. I highly recommend it."
A1SD1C8XK3Z3V1_B003VWJ2K8,"great little tuner There are a TON of reviews here, and I don't have a lot to add. You can read about what this tuner does and does not do in the specs section or from other reviewers who tend to review specs instead of how they like or dislike something. Bottom line, this is my favorite headstock tuner. I also own the new NS mini and it has its own qualities that I like as well (like being small), but it doesn't fit on my Godin's headstock. This tuner, the SNARK, fits on my Godin's small headstock with no problems. On a dark stage this works great. I love this little tuner. five stars."
A2D0F87RY5YMHN_B0002CZVW8,Kyser Caps Are An Easy Recommendation This is my 6th Kyser capo.  This one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 is what I needed.  I always recommend all Kyser Capos.They last forever and do not lose the strong holds.
A3UXW18DP4WSD6_B000M23OQ8,"Love it Had a guitar for years,, always tune it but never time to practice, it tells you what note is actually being played when your string is out of tune so you can zero in on the correct one better.."
A35P0LNBJ0WUPL_B0007SL86A,"A good design and mostly positive This works better than the QK10B model by the same company.  Slim and easy to install though longer than the QK10B.  Since the cut out and button are on only one side of the two parts, you might have to rotate a mic boom, etc., to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts.  My use was for an IPad clamp attached to a mic stand.  It worked well and I put two of these in place so the stand could break down for packing in a gear bag.  This unit wiggles a little but not as much as the QK10B so the little bit of movement is acceptable.  This looks to be well built and should be reliable. The long haul will be the test."
A3QPN05Y1OUX32_B0018TC3I4,"Perfect! For me this stand is very well built, not hard to assemble pretty much a no brainer and a great price. They don't touch the floor. There are safety straps that hold my 3 acoustic guitars (Fender, Ibanez and my anybody's guess antique)in place without any difficulty, so I don't have to worry about knocking them off or over. It takes up very little space, the biggest plus!"
A2MR43RDPZX3J_B0027M30Z6,"Tiny but projects well I bought this because I was going on a trip and needed an amp I could pack in my suitcase that would work with a battery.I had a similar amp before that died. The Honeytone is very compact, but looks cool and is very simple to operate, with just three controls, volume, tone and gain (distortion). I found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume. If you try playing clean, with no distortion, you'll be underpowered. The trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation. I tried a regular electric guitar, a lap steel guitar, a slide guitar, an acoustic-electric guitar, an acoustic-electric mandolin and a silent banjo. I thought the acoustic guitar would overwhelm this little amp, but I was surprised that it added to the projection and wasn't bad on the tone. It has a handy belt clip and a useless little leather handle (just for looks). I am using it to play an electric instrument in jamming situations where everyone else is playing acoustic, and I can adjust my volume to blend in. I think a mike with an unbalanced output (1/4&#34; phone jack) would also work in here, for street corner singing, for instance, though I haven't tried that yet as all my mikes use XLR jacks and there would be the issue of a mike stand or a lapel or headphone mike with a phone jack output, which might be hard to find.Overall, I'm very pleased with this amp and it seems sturdy and reliable so far, and at $20, a bargain."
A1GOLQ90G6MHK6_B003B01QR2,Max mAx maX! I use this pick for first time and it feels great and MAX GRIP for sure. Now I do not have to worry loosing pick and my mind while I'm leading and playing in worship. It feels little bit stiffer than regular .66mm nylon pick (I used to use this one) and I love feeling and sound when I play guitar!
A3ENT7V0MT34WP_B000KIRT38,One mean piece of equipment!! I've been playing with this a lot since I got it last week. It really is versatile as well as noiseless. I've mostly used it with the default settings.I haven't had the time to tweak it as much as I'd like but I can say that it is quite easy to get different tones from it. Really impressed with this wah!
A2EDYSY4M8TESS_B002G1UT5C,"Suits me I like these, nice tortoise look with planet wave logo is nice, they have more flex than most which I also find suits me.They ride a little higher for me, which I also like, but if you like low, let's say midway across cuticle, may find a bit pinchy?  But I find the gauge suits me great and overall comfort is good, for my average thumb size."
A20TFY5J3WNJU2_B002IJK0H4,Excellent choice. new favorite. Nice grip. Sound articulate. Durable. Nice!!!!! I own HUNDREDS of picks and this is my new favorite. I bought 2 gauges. Both are going to be used for years.
AQES9A9BCJ7CV_B0002F77B8,"Bang for your Buck. I wanted a 12 string, but did not want to spend a lot of money, this guitar fits the bill. The finish is much darker then the pictures online show. GREAT SOUND from this bad boy. This is a BIG GUITAR, once I figured out how to tune the 12 string, it really DOES NOT GO OUT OF TUNE.. After I few hours of play, I retune it and its marginally out of tune, I thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality, while they are not grover tuners, they get it done.The downside for me is, not the guitar's fault.. this is an inexpensive guitar and a FANTASTIC entry into 12 string playing, this Guitar is hard to play below the 15th fret as there is no cut away, but that is true of all guitars using this body type. Now that I have had it awhile I would love for it to be acoustic/electric but again.. for the price, I was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action. Im keeping it."
A13798OPDBLDCO_B0002HLL8G,Cool These look great on my guitar. I was hoping these would help make my guitar sound brighter but defiantly didn't. I would recommend these they look great. The ones I got look almost exactly as the ones in the picture.
A386KVFXZR6XL8_B000NJ2TIE,"As needed. My band had no PA or mics or anything.  While I admit these are not the quality a band will work up to, they fill up the stands at an affordable price.  Not much distance--you have to &#34;eat&#34; the mics--but the sound is great.  Full range, clear (not muddy), and no breaking up of sound.  This is a great place to begin."
A2XKROL6XBFHT3_B0052S3WFU,"GREAT mandolin pick Picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while.  I really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge, which gives a warm round sound, but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound, all you need to do is file down one edge to what you'd like and you can have it all.  Great pick, I recommend it."
A3H4PZB9PGMWAA_B003GEBGA0,Very cheap and great for price but recording with this isn't the best ... Very cheap and great for price but recording with this isn't the best idea. good for live performance on a budget
A3AGHEETVTCBQI_B0002MSQVQ,"The best I've ever used. Period. There a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today. Sure, some are said to be the best at this or that, but for me the RAT is the one that does it all. And at a great price to boot. This pedal is not new to me. I've had a few of them in the past, but the RAT 2 is just a great as the older ""vintage"" models. Goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a Tube Screamer, to a near fuzztone, with some warm, smooth creamy tones in between. Remarkable. No other distortion pedal can do it as well. I've been playing for 5 decades and have had more than my share of them. But the RAT delivers. No joke. It just does it all, and well.The Filter (tone) is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise. That might thow a few folks off, but it's a little thing really. The Filter is the core of it's tone and the Distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion. By going higher with the Distortion control, the volume only goes up a little. That's great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit, the volume won't go through the roof.100% silent switching. No hum. No buzz. And no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit. Flawless comes to mind here. Easy to set up. Strong as a Tiger tank. And just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of 6 or 8 knobs for you to mess with. And the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the RATs of the past. Kinda cool if you ask me.If one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues, get yourself a RAT. If you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a ""boo-teek"" pedal that sits in the RAT's shadow, buy that high dollar unit and you can at least ""Look Good"" while you play. But your tone will still stink. Its up to you. Me? Its a no brainer. I go with the RAT...."
A1EVEQAR05SY7L_B001GWCC4I,Not much help The plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket doesn't grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag. it's a great idea but not well executed.
ACVSCM9GWLNLS_B0002E1O2W,"they are ok if you like this guage you'd like these.. I just tried them, just to try.. but I've confirmed I like heavier gauges."
A2XB18IXOKUV82_B0037M62AK,"Not really thought it was going to be this cheap. This strap is pretty thin.  Not like some of the other for the same price that I have purchased on Amazon.  Still does its job, but we'll see how the quality is after a while,"
A1SJ32WZWVEI61_B0006NDF6C,Nice price! I was surprised at the good quality for such a little price. It does exactly what I needed it for.
A1GMWTGXW682GB_B001C74GLY,"Thicker than the 'F' plate and nicer than the MIM stock plate I ordered this after I saw one on a squier bass at a local shop. The plate looks great on my MIM fender Telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the Fender 'F' plate I see on other guitars. I used the screws and it was an easy install. Other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate. The plate has five screw holes, but doesn't look bad using 4.This is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my MIM Telecaster."
A37KJ0QD8HYF7A_B000RVWY42,"it's a hit and miis for behringer behringer may be cheap, but they do create some good products, for this one it's a hit and miss. although i ordered three of them."
A396ELNTQDFYPO_B000NJ2TIE,Replaced My SM-58 I had some band mates that did not seem to respect my Shure SM-58 mics very well so I bought some of these cheap mics to use on them. I was very surprised to find that I like the sound of my voice better through one of these than my old reliable SM-58 (and these Behringer mic's are about 1/10 the price each.No problem with feedback or handling noiseNo problem with electronic induced noiseSounds goodDirt cheapHandy carrying caseWhat's not to like?
A24JUT24W1K3CV_B0002D0CLC,"Solid & Secure To Use I have always been a thin or medium 351 style pick person, but when a fellow musician had one of these on stage I was quite surprised at how well it worked. I have used it on guitar and also on bass and it really works well with a good solid grip to it."
AFB7MSIPJIW68_B0002Z2CZY,"Interesting change **Update 9/7/12**Ok I've been using these for a few weeks now, and I have to say I keep going back to them. They make the notes sound like bells. It's holding up better than I expected (I am a relatively soft player) and I'm adjusting to the 'stickiness' mentioned below. I am liking these more and more as time goes by. Glad I tried these!**Original Review**Recently I got the itch to try different 'unique' picks... these, the dunlop primetones, felt picks, metal picks, etc. I get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picks.These are interesting. They perform quietly and give a more mellow tone. They do however stick to the strings and it becomes difficult to use them, will need some getting used to. I wish I had ordered the hard version rather than the medium, as these are a bit softer than I was hoping.Probably won't be a daily driver, but interesting none the less."
A1OGTL9EBDTK3N_B000PO30QM,This a good cable This is great for adding pedals. You cant go wrong for this item with the price even more so thank you
AGX9PFO7K90DJ_B0017HZ47Y,"Excellent gig bag The construction, fabric, color and padding are all A-1. This is a super bag! My precious uku will always be protected and look good too."
A19IFF0DGV0T3E_B0002CZVXM,"Vastly Superior Design/Function compared to Schaller Style What's great about the Dunlop design:They work!  The only thing you need to do is ensure you've got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.The design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post, which is exactly what you want.  The schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my family's experience.  We will never run anything other than this design going forward.What doesn't work with the Schaller Design:Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us."
A1NPG8GYIXYIVY_B0002D0CEO,Good all rounder! Great picks for beginners and pros alike! Go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing.
A2Z89YMZZJWBHS_B004TGVRDA,"Economical And Useful I decided to try out the M5 in order to add some more effects options while replacing a tuner and analog delay on my pedal board. While I haven't explored all of the sounds yet, I have found some useable ones.You really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets. Flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation. Also, factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so much.Here are some that I've personally found to be appealing so far:Delay: Analog w/Mod- a nice sounding Memory Man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalReverb: Room- standard adjustable digital delay, not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicEnvelope Filter: Tron Up- a Winner! fully functional and authentic envelope follower, FUNKY!Synthy: Seeker- a very cool filter for single guitar notes.Octave: Bass Octaver- One note below only but quite effective especially for loopers.You will also find (as expected with a multi-effects pedal) many unpractical, downright silly-sounding noise makers. Not to say you won't find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless we're talking about a 4:20 headphones session ;) Also, don't depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless you're using it as an addition to your amp's lead channel.Construction seems pretty sturdy other than the ""Model Select"" button which is a multi-use knob with push-down / turn action and is cheapy-cheap. It's awkward and uncomfortable to use, fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up. I already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets.Having the choice between True-Bypass and DSP is a really nice touch (and unheard of on stomp boxes) as people have different needs here depending on your signal chain.The tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position. I do miss my KORG Pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connection.I personally wanted things like octave, envelope, phaser, etc. available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually. The M5 is serving that purpose. The sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist. They should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone. Just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package."
A3GJ25QG91UI9Y_B0015RIN6U,Korg Pitchblack True Bypass Chromatic Tuner Pedal with 4 Display Modes Excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning. Well-designed and rugged construction. I believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least 50% more. One-button operation makes it simple to operate.
A2O8BAXJPDSV0M_B002T45X1G,"Wonderful! Brass Tacks: is this the greatest mic in the world? No. But on a budget this mic is AMAZING. The lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out. If you are looking for s nice rich sound, this is it.If you want to upgrade from a headset, cheap mic, Blue Yeti, or AT-2020; buy this mic and an audio interface. You won't regret it."
A1URXSRV6WDHVY_B0002E2S36,"All 12 packed in mini zip-lock! I have used Fender Medium picks since the late 60's.  Yes, they are made in China now (!!) but they are still the same pick as far as I can tell.  The picks arrived fully sealed in an outer envelope and contained within a nice little mini zip-lock baggie.  All 12 were in there, all of them Fender Mediums.  (purchased from B&G; Music Associates)  Shipped from Illinois to California in 3 days with normal shipping.The picks are great and I couldn't be happier with the order. Whatever issues occurred with missing picks and poor shipping no longer exist from where I stand.  Recommended if you want/need a nice little bag of Fender Mediums."
A2CZIZD0RZ566T_B0026RB0G8,"For the money, you can't buy anything better. It does the job. The only problem is that it sticks out a little to far down underneath the guitar neck thus impeding the fingers from taking the right position for some of the chords. You slide it up and away, you might loose pressure on strings and your guitar will make funny noises especially if you use hard strings. For the money, it does the job ok. It's a good one for beginers like myself."
AMVC9WTXYKNJ1_B0002GMGYA,"Working cord I plugged in the amp, and I plugged in the bass, and there were no issues with the wire.  This is one of those products you don't want to overly notice, and in that it has done the job is is designed for."
A3CUYX2VXZM9KO_B0002E5266,"Good Stands for the Money I needed a couple of extra boom stands instead of a regular stand for a couple of my cymbalsand set these up and I am pretty happy with them.. They could have been a litte taller, howeverthere pretty good duty and do a good job for the money.  You could do better however you willpay quite a bit extra.  I would buy more if I needed them."
A30J7WQV0ZNRXG_B0002E3CHC,"Smooth and Sweet: Great Phosphor Bronze Strings! I am an acoustic guitar addict. With five six-string and one-twelve, I play every day and, in a year's time, I go through a lot of strings. Over the years, I have come to favor the phosphor-bronze type as they seem to add something to the rich and warm tones of a good instrument. For a long time, I believed that brands of them were interchangeable so I bought whatever was available at the best price. No more. These D'Addarios are the sweetest, easiest to play and, not that this is the most important variable to me - the longest lasting - of any of the phosphor bronze strings I have used.There is a shelf of unopened sets of unopened Martins, Gibsons, GHS, Adamas and Elixirs (as well as other varieties of D'Addario strings.) I think it's time to sell them off. These EXP16s are superior to them all.I have small hands and my fingers are not terribly strong. To play as well as I am able, I require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up. Sound-wise, I look for a blend of 'brightness' and 'warmth' on my strings thst enrich and punctuate the innate qualities of a good guitar. These D'Addarios do both things and do them well.Other reviewers have been somewhat critical about the 'slickness' of these strings - I simple did not experience that at all. As with ALL guitar strings, they should be wiped with a dry, lint-free cloth after each and every playing. Not doing so will quickly compromise the accurate resonance and vibrations of ANY string. As a bonus, the price of these strings is quite reasonable. I bought 6 sets and plan to use them all, both Mediums and Lights, for my stringed friends."
A1H4WSC8JWS59N_B002C741BI,"it' okay. I know when I ordered it, I was buying a cheap device, and didn't expect it to be great.  It works. That should be enough, but amazon requires a certain number of words."
A121QRWXZIO6UP_B000P5OULA,"Couldn't Be Happier So based on the reviews from Amazon, and a friend who swears by these pickups, I decided to put one into my 310 Taylor.I am extremely pleased!  This was my brother's guitar, and he had a Mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop.  It sounded terrible.  I tried messing with placement to get it to sound better, but it just didn't sound good, had tons of feedback, and just didn't have a good feel.I installed this pickup myself.  I have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars, and this one was pretty painless.I didn't have to drill out the endpin hole, so it only took me about 20 minutes to install this bad boy.When I tested it out I was blown away.  It sounded beautiful!  Just like my Taylor, only louder!The true test was an actual live performance.  I brought my Baggs Para Acoustic D.I. and I was glad I did.I was able to adjust the EQ just a tad, cut some of the mid-range a bit, and it sounded even better!I could not believe it.  It literally gave me chills.If you're on the fence about this pickup, go for it!  The reviews don't lie, this sounds fantastic, especially if you can EQ it a bit.I did plug in without the PADI, just to test it and it still sounded good.  If I forgot my PADI I would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system.  It might be labeled as passive, but it's got the volume of an active system for sure!It's a great buy in my opinion."
A127K5WGHNUUH3_B001FSZR4U,String Cleaber is great I chose this because I wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings. So far it has worked beautifully.
A1LQC225SE8UNI_B0002E2TTO,"Sturdy but slightly less-than-perfect Even though the title says ""Acoustic Guitar Case"", it's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins. I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo, and the reviews were good. Sure enough, the lining is soft and well-padded. The hardware works as it should, and the build quality is almost perfect. However, when closing the case, a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place, then everything is as it should be. The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly, and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. It serves its purpose well, at a reasonable price."
ACFBLRCKLPR00_B003VWKPHC,"Nice Tuner! This tuner is cool. It picks up even the lightest vibrations, i/e: I can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out. I also like the capo tuning feature. You put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x. I highly recommend this tuner."
A3EXWV8FNSSFL6_B001J1JRN0,"An Excellent Practice or Small Gig Amp The Fender Vibro Champ is a great little amp. I'm amazed at how good this amp sounds. A small light weight package with a good set of voices that outputs a decent amount of sound.This is a 5 Watt Tube amp with enough power to fill a medium sized room or the perfect practice amp. This is a much better and louder amp than the small $100 solid state starter / practice amps by all the major manufacturers. Fender uses two very standard tubes for pre- and amplification: 12AX7 and 6V6 (both are Fender branded tubes). These are nice clean tubes that react consistently.The amp takes about 15 seconds to warm up and draws 45 Watts.The cool part of this amp is the 16 voice settings. In reality the amp packs effects for 7 different amps, Tweed, Blackface, British, Hot Rod, Metal, Jazz, and Acoustic. The first five have three different levels of style each. Our other two amps are Marshalls, an acoustic and a half stack. If I'm being really honest, I like the sound of this amp a lot more than the half stack. This is a clean simple amp to use. The Marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right.The volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched. Some voices are incredibly loud, others are really quiet. Switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot. Sadly, the volume only goes to 10.Once the voice is selected, there are 5 effects settings possible with two or three level for each (Vibratone, Delay, Reverb, Chorus, and Tremolo). The F/X level knob adjusts the amount of the effect applied (set to 1, the effect isn't used at all). This is probably the least useful part of the amp. There is no pedal selection, so once the effect is selected and volume dialed in, you're kind of stuck with that until you fiddle with the amp again. There's no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song.There is a gain knob.I like the speaker on this amp. It is nicely detailed with a good warm sound. The internal speaker is connected with a 1/4 inch jack, so it is possible to connect the amp up to another cabinet with a simple 1/4 inch speaker cable. Very nicely done Fender, most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker. The back panel also has a 1/4 inch jack Line Out.This is a great small gig or practice amp. The sound is outstanding. The amp is used with a 1983 Gibson Lucille and a 2008 Les Paul Standard Plus."
AD6FULWPPOJ3R_B0002KZHQA,Nice polishing cloth - good price Great price on a high-quality polishing cloth.Not much else to say about it - it polishes my guitar very nicely.
A3DDG0WH5SBF34_B009ZX8ZJG,"Cheaply made, only lasted a few months I have been using this gig bag for the past few months. If I do the math, I probably didn't use it more than 10 times, basically from home to the subway, from the subway to the studio and back, so maybe 20 minutes walk each time. So I used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes, mostly carrying it on my shoulders, sometimes by one of the two handles.Then the side handle started coming apart: the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used. It will be OK for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking (which I kind of expect at this point!). Meanwhile I'm going to buy another (sturdier) gig bag.Save your money and get something better than this."
A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN_B005M0CK9M,"WOW ! This pedal lives up to the hype. Distortion-wise, it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type OD and a full on distortion (like a Crunchbox or Rat).  I checked out several Youtube demonstrations before I took the plunge on this one.  I think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos - more transparent and organic sounding. I have owned the Fulltone OCD in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly.  I also own a V1 Dano Cool Cat OD - which is an excellent OCD-ish pedal- but this one is getting more action these days.  I am running this into the front of either a Palomino V32 or a Jet City 20 watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup.  The pedal also plays well with others-  I am getting nice lead tones by running a TS type of OD into the front of this one.  The JF-02 is a really nice dirtbox - and not just for the price.  The fact that you can own it for 40 clams or less makes it a no-brainer for those of you who (like myself) are addicted to dirtboxes.  I have noticed some price gouging with  a few vendors on here.  Shop around.  I knew the build quality was decent because I own the Joyo Vintage Overdrive and they are both built like bricks."
AENULRBQ2IE5I_B0007ORM0K,"Chibson owners I just installed these on my Chibson LP from overseas. I had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger.. I took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards, not forwards, by hand slowly, until it was perfect. I also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case I slipped. Took me about 1.5 hours.The ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance. Really close, but they were terrible in operation. I have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar. Haven't played them yet, but all the reviews were good, so here goes.....Update:  Played for a couple hours. First thing I notice is that they are geared lower than the old Chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars.. You tune it a full turn, and the tune moves up slightly. Which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment.This fixed the Chibson tuning issue. I'll order another set for my other Chibson.Also, I have two Epiphones. I believe these are nicer than the Epi's.So I bought based solely on the reviews here. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I am pretty impressed. good replacement for ""iffy"" tuners. They worked for me..."
A204ETWOV23HO4_B0002E2XCW,"What's there to say, really, except that they're good picks. I wish I could say that they let me play more like Frank Zappa, but only practice can make that happen.These are solid picks, they don't break apart, they're easy to hold, and they work exactly as a pick should work, and at a good price."
AQT4V74P38PPU_B001FQ74FW,"Ernie Ball Quality Quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any Ernie Ball products,great, very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces, not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces. I have them on several bass cabinets, they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use."
A245MWTMXYXXHY_B0002GIW3Y,Seem to be quality strings Everyone has there opinions. I was told these were great strings by some and others tell me the quality control has slipped after the passing of John. What I can say is the strings go on really brassy bright for a few days. They slowly mellow out and seem to last a long time. Sound really nice on my Taylor 410CE.
A6GXP9ESXIH7O_B0002OP7VQ,"Neato ! Love this mini giant of a speaker I 'm obviously not a &#34;Techie&#34;.  I couldn't understand how my delightful, and so neat, little toy wouldn't work... until I found out that the battery was wrapped in cellophane - A-ha!To be fair I must explain that the battery was already installed in the tiny little amp when it arrived, so I didn't look too closely at it.  But of course when I couldn't get it to work for me, I soon discovered the problem.This product is the neatest, sweetest little delight for the eyes...and will astound you with it's capacity to roar out your music when turned up fully and respond immediately to your slightest touch on it's sweet little knobs to sound out your music from there and down to a whisper,  whenever you require it to.The sound from the speaker is as clear as a bell...no static at all...Truly an amazing little gadget... attractive, so portable and does the job of one twice, or more,  of it's size."
A2XF1IANVPK7F_B0002D0CA8,"These strings retain a good feeling for a long time These strings retain a good feeling for a long time, well past the point of them needing changed because they've lost brightness."
A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN_B000M23OQ8,"Does the trick- just barely... I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store.  Who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right?  The price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well.  The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate.  It gets you in the ballpark, but just barely.  Strike a note once, and it's sharp.  Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune.  I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better."
A2FY8306QHI5LE_B0002F7K7Y,"Good all around strings Keeping in mind the difference types of guitars and pickups, these D'Addario strings are good strings for all around use. They are suitable for rock, punk, country, and funk. Sure, you could spend more on ""boutique"" specialty strings to give you that exact ""vintage"" sound, but these strings are just fine whether you play in the bedroom, garage or club.I like the light guage .010's because they are easy on the fingers, but are still beefy sounding compared to thin sounding .009's and .008's."
A2U67NUNCRHVO7_B002CMLPYY,Great soft strap Nice to see something well made for a change.  Most guitar straps I see that are less than $80.00 are all cheap and that fake stuff.
A2C46HQIZLYJUC_B005CX4GLE,"Works Great! Even Better Than I Expected I love this wall hanging mount. Of course, you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud, or use drywall backing screws, etc, but that's just common sense.The actual product works perfectly and exactly as described. The arms are adjustable & stay where you put them. This fits my 5string Fender Jazz Bass as well as my acoustic guitar & violin (and even holds the neck without touching the pegs, if you want it to). I will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments.This is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to."
A1VAUZRF5PUSOZ_B003AYPT8G,"double the size of the chinese tremolo system I gave this a 5 star for the simple fact that this tremolo has a bigger block for more sustain and a better all around intonation on any cheaply made guitar, I replaced this with the one that came on my squier affinity strat and let me just say the sustain and over all tone has been shaped on my guitar, it now stays in better tune and sounds amazing, I did also replace the tuners on my chinese made squier as well so that also helps with this tone, sustain and intonation and playing ability of the guitar"
A1VFUMY02HJIFY_B00646MZHK,"I'm pleased Wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment.So far, works well.Sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string, but generally works great. Can tune up quickly every time."
A5RJ7TM82RH0I_B0002CZST4,"Sounds Perfect I have an electro acoustic Martin (second hand but without a scratch). I got it with .13 strings and well, is simply too much. Is good to play rithyms but can't do pretty much nothing else.I have installed a set (I got 8) and it sounds really good. Not as solid as the .13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easier.Recomended"
A149F91FB9WTW6_B0002H0A3S,"this is a good value i love these strings.  i had limited experience selecting strings for my acoustic but as soon as i tried these, i really enjoyed them.  after reading reviews realized i actually made a good purchase.  no desire to test other strings.  especially after this bundle/value."
A38SICZYZTLDQ9_B0064BFNME,"Best string on the market! I've been using these strings on all my guitars, electric and acoustic, since the mid-70s.  I've tried many others, but always come back to Ernie Balls.  They tune better and they keep the ""new strings"" sound longer and that's the main plus, but they just ""feel"" good.  I play and practice a lot and I abuse strings...these can take it and come back for more!"
A18X6ZT4AEYVKB_B009MBT68U,"solid stand solid good stand, it is decent quality and doesn't have any places that will break easily.  can take anywhere you want"
A2JQWSA0GPVSQN_B00378GEAM,"Nice, Convenient, Good Sound I like this speaker system, behringer makes good products when it comes to this. The sound is good and loud, you can control the levels and EQ directly from this so no need for a mixer. You can connect an ipod or laptop to it. And there are multiple sound options including phantom, and instrument. I used a female xlr to 1/4 trs cable but I have been told you can also use xlr to xlr, although I did not try it. The price was great and the wattage was nice. I must say, when we have people come over it is easier to hear them sing. With me playing on the piano it is sometimes hard to hear their voices but now it is equal and sounds nice in harmony. I also connected to microphones to it and it distributes the sound very evenly so it sounds good in a duet.UPDATE: I recently bought a guitar and started to use this amp for my electric fender, IT WORKS GREAT! The sound is great, the wattage is good, everything is wonderful. Highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar."
A2SFO875EQ66AB_B000OY707S,"Boss FS-6 Foot Switch Works well.  Very well constructed.  Would it kill ya to add an on/off switch so that the batteries don't run down?  Other than that, it's perfect!"
A12N7TJQR2RB9W_B000JRPYGE,"LOVE it!!! This mic is fantastic! I've been singing, writing, and recording for almost 30 years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive German mics I've used in larger studios over the years. There's a very slight presence peak, but nothing like most of the other Chinese mics. It isn't shrilling or peaky at all. Male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for EQ whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub 100hz stuff. This mic is also an excellent candidate for a Michael Joly mod, he calls it one of the 7 audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under $200. Michael mods these mics and you'd be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous U87 with the German name that starts with an ""N"". I'm using it totally stock and it's been great. Buy it."
A1M957IA3QNX7X_B007T8KI6M,"Nice little EQ I was hesitant to pick up an overdrive or delay from Joyo but took a chance on the EQ.  I really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should.  I use it mostly as a boost with a slight shaping of the EQ but it can be used to get a scooped sound, mids boost, hi/lowpass or whatever you need.  It's a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass.  When the pedal is engaged the 6 lights for each band come on and they seem sturdy enough.I would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed.  Not the performance side of the pedal as far as I can tell, but for example, the ""N"" on the ""IN"" label on the right is backwards, and it comes in a weird box with plenty of Engrish so I'm skeptical as to how it will hold up to being stomped on.  Time will tell, but for now it seems like a great box for the money."
A2CKMJU4WD3XDE_B0014IEBM0,"Great... I bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer. That solution was successful. These speakers put out enough power that I can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp. I have a 75Watt amp that powers a 12"" celestion speaker. These monitors have 70Watts powering a 5"" Woofer and a 1"" Tweeter, 40W/30W respectively. Slight drop in the power output, but they are beefy enough that I don't really notice.The isolation pads they come with are paper thin, almost pointless. If you really need some, get some more substantial pads. The back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours... not really concerned about that, but it's worth mentioning.They have great sound, excellent low end, lots of clarity throughout. They are pricey, but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon. I would really recommend not going to a retailer... even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online. Only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors."
A1KO6FM2PGCYC8_B0002GMGYA,"Ok Not the greatest cord I have ever used, not the worst either. I would prefer Fender Tweed cables over this one if I had to make a recommendation."
A18LZ6VHS4DK69_B000E0PPG0,Great stand for the price I own a mobile DJ company and have 4 ultimate TS-90 stands and i'm really not happy with them.  This product is simple does the job and is well priced.  They are a little heavy at 9 lbs per stand but i like the look and operation of them.  I've been happy with them so far.
A38DCVO9SZHW68_B0040O49OU,It's the right size. I have had trouble finding uke sized straps and have often had to use the larger guitar straps. This fits just right and looks just right.  It's well made and not too expensive.  I just wish I had found them before buying all those guitar straps.
A2MAGKKVHUF21F_B0027M30Z6,"Yo'd better to buy a big one. Sounds disgusting. Very bright and clear highs, nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows. Don't hope to take chords on it. Only on first 4 strings may be...Try out fender's mini amp if you're searching for a little thing, or but a bigger one."
A2F2L5F9OWWVY6_B004TQJ174,"Badass When I bought this pedal I was thinking a heavy distortion. But when I got it and played with it I figured out it was alot different that advertised. It is a acdc, Steve Vaughn kind of pedal. It's got an attitude but it soft at the same time. It's truly a one of a kind product. I would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal. Make a note it is not a metal pedal. Not by any means actually. But for what it is it is fantastic."
A1ROUMJOGO4QMB_B001L8MDMS,"Fender/Squire should standardize their drillings The screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar, and you would think they would want to standardize so they didn't have to carry so many parts.  Nope, doesn't fit a Squire Affinity, just FYI."
A3CUYX2VXZM9KO_B000J5XS3C,A Lot of Bang for the Buck !! the Beringer 802 mixer is by far the lowest costing and best performing mixer for the price on the market..  Works fantastic and I am very happy with it..
A1FJBWP2R3NSH4_B0038O9NLM,"Very Nice Strap -- But Not For Me This is a very high quality strap. The supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship.However, I don't like the plastic end pieces. They are large and -- well -- plastic. So I'm sending it back.I'm going to go with an inexpensive nylon strapProtec Guitar Strap with Leather Ends and Pick Pocket, Blackand straplocksSchaller Security Locks - Nickelfor about the same price.This is mainly a matter of personal preference. If you don't mind the plastic end pieces, this is a beautiful strap."
A3VVKC910FN4EK_B00IZCSW3M,Great Great strings with a good feel to them. They are size 10-46 which is just right for my electric guitars. I won't know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey. If they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and I will switch if they last a long time. I don't think of these as extra lights (09-42) they are more of a light to me.
A3K6M4WXNTYQEM_B00074B67A,"Not big enough for normal straps I purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap. Way too small, maybe like a third of the width. I just have a normal planet waves strap, and it does not fit. However, it does hold the XDS transmitter nicely and securely. So looks like I will have to get creative with duct tape or something.UPDATE:When attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap, it stays on pretty snugly. But you need to attach it with something."
A22810LZ1TDWH2_B0002F519I,like them these do a good job of isolating out the sound.  They work very well.  Would recommend it to other people
A3G4YMDOTVWP5V_B005M0CK9M,"Great overdrive. I've had this for nearly a year and I have no complaints. Works perfectly. Sounds awesome. Lots of gain, tons more than my Boss SD-1 w/the Monte Allums SD808 mod.  If lost or stolen, I'd buy another. Highly recommended."
ALEFGB3G2BYG8_B000VJJQUU,"best deal cheap cables the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES"
A3ADSZR7QAQ5U_B0055V7UR0,gUITAR pICKS The sampler pack was a good variety of pick thicknesse and are useful in finding out what type of picks are most useful in playing various guitar styles.
A1N46MR82AUE4T_B0002GJ3ZA,Great! These picks work well and look as pictured. The shade of pink is very close to that in the picture. I would recommend them.
ADH0O8UVJOT10_B0002M6CVC,"The ONLY strings I will use I've tried several different strings on electric, and Ernie Ball Slinkys are the only ones I really trust on all of my guitars.  The fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus.  But they sound great, and are far less prone to breakage than other brands I have tried.  The 9's are super fast and easy to bend, but I've started using 10's more often on my Strats, which creates an even more robust sound.  They're an industry standard for a reason - you don't need 15 dollar strings!"
A3IURSDK689G7M_B000EEL6J6,Good value Great prce
A3DCG2MNPR4BW_B0009G1E0K,LOVE 'EM!! These are really well made straps for the money! The only problem I had was that I wished I had ordered more of them!!!!
A3UXW18DP4WSD6_B002433RXI,"worked well if you are brave enough to drill into your ukulele for a strap these are for you,  I was hesitant at first, but this did the job."
A2Y1R8CZMTALJP_B004HJ9COU,"Waste of Money The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. I don""t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it. The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound. This cable is complete garbage. Never again!"
A2LBHMQ3142G3S_B000P5LVSK,"My favorite Jazz III, absurdly priced If you are fan of the Jazz III you will definitely like the Ultex version.  From my experience, the Ultex has the sound and feel of Tortex but without the ""memory"" aka wear.  The Ultex is thicker than the standard nylong Jazz III's and only when directly compared will you notice that the Ultex version has a slightly larger gripping surface.Five stars for being a better Jazz III.  However, the prices for these on amazon are absurd.  I got mine through musiciansfriend for around $2 shipped."
A1W93CKNN8D6L2_B0002M6CVC,Great tone The fact of the price for this and the 18 cent shipping is pretty damn good Because I have 2 Silverstone SS-11's and a stratocaster and I took parts of of one ss-11 to fix the other then I bought these strings for it Fixed it up And now that guitar sounds better and less (Buzzy) than the strat Also pretty cool how it came with free picks which is nice becuase I lose them alot and one side of my thumb feels like a brick and the other side feels like a pillow Anyways great product nice little thank you note and free picks and REALLY cheap shipping I will buy more later to fix my other guitar when I get the bridge nuts replaced
A204ETWOV23HO4_B0026RB0G8,"Works perfectly, solidly made, and strong grip It really has everything that one could ask for in a guitar capo - it's a quality well-made tool that isn't going to fall apart any time soon; it has a strong spring, so it grips the neck and strings quite solidly; and it's easy to open up and clamp on the neck.Can't really say anything more than that this really is a well-made capo that works just exactly and precisely as a capo is supposed to work.I love it!"
AXMYGK3WC8BPP_B0002H02IG,"Broke almost immediately?! I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but I didn't want any down time, so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time, and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine, I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. So, I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable."
A2LBHMQ3142G3S_B0002F7K7Y,"Lives up to the hype, my new favorite strings. These strings have made me a D'Addario customer for life.  The sound and feel are perfect, and I find that they last much longer than more expensive coated strings.  I have no desire to buy any other brand.These strings are NOT over-hyped."
AWIG50VOI5VUV_B001LNN30E,"VERY NICE PLAYING AND SOUNDING I needed a nice sounding classical guitar for dinner gigs.  I went to the large Guitar store and tried out several in this price range and couple hundred above and settled on this one because of the sweet sound and workmanship.  For the money I don't think it can be beat.  Mahogany not plywood sides and back and Cedar top make for a really nice mellow tone and a bone nut and saddle thrown in for good measure.  Bone does make a considerable difference I have found.  All the finish is excellent.  Now for some down sides.  Yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends.  As for leveling it seemed OK.  So I took some time and masked off the fret board and finished the frets flush with the fingerboard and rounded the sides and tops.  Cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it.  You can make your own clear plastic pick guards to any size by going to Wal Mart and in the material sewing department you will find clear plastic in large rolls.  You can buy a half yard long x 54"" and make enough pick guards to last a life time for a couple bucks.  It clings to the gloss finish nicely. (Do not use this on old guitars with Nitro finish it will eat the finish instantly)  Same goes when changing strings.  Put some masking tape at the end of the bridge on the top to prevent the strings from scratching the Cedar top.  Overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down.  I put a Baggs I-Beam pickup in it also.  Easy installation and nice natural sound.  It is nice as it does not have a big EQ cut into the side of the body."
A3HCK3UXD6WS4G_B003KQY8DQ,On the hard side These picks are ok if you need them to be on the stiff side. I was looking for a semi-soft felt picks.
A1365RYO0BLEMI_B0002CZV7I,"Great Pedal but YOU WILL need a noise gate. As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned, 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal'. I completely agree with that. And it will sustain your notes. It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain. But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up. The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate. I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals. That said, this pedals has some wonderful uses. Every note will have the same volume. You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume. You can set it to sustain for days. Again, you will need a noise gate. There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors, but none of them are as ""ACTIVE"" as this one. Perhaps that's the price you pay for what this pedal can do. I recommend messing with it quite a while. You can do some incredible funk, jazz, metal vibes out of it."
A1YR3RVSBZK8CW_B000CCJP4I,"too noisy!!! the effect it self is fine, but it is too noisy even though u don't dime it, for the price, and for this product, it is u get what u pay for."
ASEBPAY8IBNI2_B003AYNHGW,Great springs! At first I wanted to get these to replace the 3 cheap springs to came in my MIM Stratocaster for it was the last thing I needed to change to have a functional reliable floating tremolo. After installing these tremolo springs (which by the way have a nice flexible tension) I notice that my tone and sustain greatly improved. I did some research and found out there are other websites out there that sell vintage specs tremolo tension springs for like $20-$30 to enhance tone and sustain on Stratocasters! So at $8 this is definitely a WIN!!!
A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN_B000MFN8B6,"Great strings I don't put these on every guitar but on the right guitar they are perfect.  What's the right guitar?  Longer scales- like a strat.  I would not put these on a shorter scale (22"") because it would get too flubby.  If you hit the power chords hard you may also want to stear clear-  these require a bit more subtlety in your attack or you will vibrate in and out of tune on the low E when you are pulling off windmills like Townshend.  They do allow super  easy string bends for when I feel lazy or for when my fingers are torn up from playing.  YMMV."
A1UPZM995ZAH90_B0002D0CEO,Tortex Picks Love these picks. Have used them for years. Feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. Highly recommend.
A396ELNTQDFYPO_B001DW6RJC,"Good for Songwriter I'm a songwriter who is always looking for compatible chords. This wheel has made if fun to find chords that work well together, its quick and easy to use."
A110ZEDSNASVCO_B0002GLDQM,"Hmmmmmm.... I'm rather disappointed with this item as I put only FOUR (4) picks into it when it snapped apart. I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.0 mm picks and perhaps that's where I was at fault - I maybe should left it at three picks.However, my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely. Thus beware of how many picks and their gauge BEFORE you push them into this holder.I give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated."
A5RJ7TM82RH0I_B0018TC3I4,"Is really good! I got mine and I gave it a try, here are the conclusions:1. It looks really good, sturdy and well made.2. Is super stable, I tried it out with: 2 Strats and a electro acoustic, then removed one  Strat and placed another acoustic (a 12 string this time). I pushed the stand and.... It holds. As guitar are hanging and they are secured on the top i believe is really difficult for a guitar/bass or whatever you put in there falls down.3. You can set the height, always considering that your guitars don't reach the floor.So....... Totally recommended!"
A1RXH9W4TZB2EF_B001QWBM62,"Excellent Clarity, Flat Response and Transparency! 4 stars because I've only used it in stereo mode and Stamina mode. Stamina Mode is supposed to run for 11 hours. Perhaps it does, but if so, it can only be when it is turned on and maybe not even in record mode. No one records 11 hours straight, so I'm guessing that turning it on and off wears the batts down sooner. If not for that, I'd have rated 4 stars. In terms of clarity, flat response and transparency, it is excellent. The Auto Rec level is very smooth and doesn't sound as if has been severely limited and squashed. At rehearsals, before the whole band kicks in, the levels are quite loud, but it comes down quickly and smoothly. In terms of the other features, I cannot comment."
A263G5WS7JFRY1_B001SC4I16,"Good deal for the price I doubt you can beat this for $25! The uke is a solid little guy.  I shimmed the bridge a little because I can play hard, but it wasn't bad. Pretty well in tune up the neck.  Strings are ok but I do have some Aquilas to put on; will see if it matters much.The tuners ARE geared, not friction like in the one picture --- at least, mine are.The carrying bag is just that, with no padding or other protection, but keeps the rain off."
A1T4HGVX32QIYC_B0002CZTIO,"Good Product This thing does just what it was supposed to, i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that, and it does just what it is supposed to"
AB7WPLA1CN5I1_B001R76D42,"Love It! The mic does exactly what I wanted it to do.  The mic has a headphone jack.  Having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings. Also, I like having the two polar patterns, switchable from cardioid to omni.I did have to back off a bit in proximity to the mic, as my voice is powerful.  Once, I got the hang of it I had no problems.I did find the bundled Cakewalk software useless.  Please refer to my review of"" Cakewalk Music Creator 6"" here on amazon.com.  It works great with my new ""Acoustica Mixcraft 5 Audio MIDI Music Recording Software V 5.""Overall, this is an awesome product."
A3ITN3125FJETP_B005MR6IHK,"Fender Clip On Purchased this tuner awhile back to be able to check my tuning periodically without having to access my in line tuner. This is a great tuner IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE USING IT FOR. With that being said, this little clip on is not intended for gig use per say. If that is what you are looking for, an inline tuner would be much more efficient and accurate. This little guy is best suited to practice (if you are like me and don't use your primary rig for at home practice and don't feel like breaking out the old pedal chain) it does the job and does it well. Now could you use it for a gig? Sure I suppose so, but bear in mind that it is not an ""in-line"" tuner therefore any excessive background noise will cause the accuracy to be a bit off. For the price it can't be beat. It swivels (although not much) but enough that you can clip it on, read the nicely lit LCD and tune up quickly. Great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar."
A95J3RNEFN425_B0002E1G5C,"Nice gadget Works a little better at winding strings than the bare-bones winders. The string cutter is very handy. The pin puller, as is usually the case, is a little clumsy to use, but it works."
A34LQ791ACZ0JC_B0002KZAKS,"Good Mic for the Money I haven't used this mic much, yet, but so far it has a great sound. It is loud and projects the voice out front of the music. For 25 bucks I don't think you can beat it. I'm happy so far. I may buy some more of them. It is not ""too short"" as one reviewer complained. It is a standard length just like the SM-58."
AENULRBQ2IE5I_B0002E3MRW,Doesnt work on dual mic clamps. Useless Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine.
A2AWJRUEY9IG4B_B000A6ASSS,Warmer Guitar Strings -  A must have for guitarists These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Still a great guitar string. A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of &#34;Goretex&#34; A real triumph of re-invention. Well done Goretex!
A2SBZZ1HSR7WSP_B001FSZR4U,"Works like a charm on my mandolin This is one of those simple gizmos that make you wonder ""why didn't i think of that"", it snaps around my mandolin strings by the bridge and a quick run up to the nut and back down  every few weeks keeps the strings clean, and best of all I don't find lint from my cleaning rag in the wound strings any more since I started using this instead of the cheesecloth I used to use."
AJK15Q9JOEHRH_B0002E2KPC,"Does the job, great price Pretty basic capo, goes on and comes off easily. Fits quickly and tightly, I expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway. Good price!"
ATJQOAUHB5XB8_B0002F7K7Y,Excellent strings These are my go-to strings. They are perfect for gig use and are inexpensive as well as awesome sounding. What more do you need?
AMP0Z3DR4RCH7_B0002CZW0Y,Perfectly Adjustable There too many required words to type for a product that doesn't need that much explanation.  It mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need.  sturdy.
ARE879SUUYGVP_B000P5NXWM,"Tusq saddle improved sound quality I bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an Aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar. The difference is quite noticeable and good. The guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a ""better than a lot more expensive guitars"" sound. I had a bone nut that cracked which is why I tried these replacements. In my estimation the sound is clearer, brighter and louder. The price seemed high for a little chunk of ""plastic"" but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied."
A319B090A2POEB_B000RMQM4E,"Stages can be wide! I have had to use these because the stage was so wide you could not use anything shorter. Most stages in bars, clubs and restaurants are small enough to use 25' mic cables and reach the stage box of the snake, but not all. These GLS Audio cables have been transparent and sturdy for the 2 months that I have been using them on an almost daily basis. I have performed many setups and tear down with these cables and there is no indication of any problem coming up any time soon."
A3DAURGJAL0Y0S_B0002F4VBM,"Great This pedal makes my Les Paul sing.  Better than I imagined, even with all the good reviews.  Such a wide range of sounds; warm jazzy boost, great blues overdrive, and almost some Black Sabbath distortion.  Makes my crappy Behringer amp sound... almost good."
A1YAR5PTXNRA7X_B0027842S4,Very solid I was looking for something more solid than the usual fold up stand and this is it.  I can put a heavy notebook full of music on it and a lamp and a tray and more stuff and it is rock solid.  Very happy.
A3PL8ENSYWS1PZ_B00154OJOI,Dava 6024 Grip Tip Picks are awesome! My son says these picks are great to use because of the rubber grippers that make it easier to hold...especially when playing the guitar for an extended period of time. Highly recommend!
A1R019TURAPFDS_B0002D0DWK,Alright These impact pads came very fast and do their job although one of the pad I received ive already warn through in less then 3 weeks
ACUGOV6HBWDXB_B0009IEB0I,"Cable fits my needs I use this for my desk mic I use for recording. It is the perfect length and the connectors are of excellent quality, especially for this price. Definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future."
A1V7G6OGGW7AGA_B001L8NGJ2,"Great pedal! I just bought a tweed Blues Jr. and love the amp. It's got a great tone, much better than the black one I had 3-4 yrs. ago. I just downsized from a 40 watt Blues Deluxe reissue and having compared them side by side I can say they sound very, very similar, as they have the same speaker, but the BJ is much lighter.That being said the fat switch really makes a lot of difference when taking a solo. I was actually surprised at how much it fattens up the tone, didn't do that on my last one. This pedal works great for that too, It feels very solid and it doesn't make any audible clicking noises that I can hear when engaging it."
A14FNPHPBHTMO4_B007YWHIP2,It works It arrived on time and was as described. Price was very reasonable.  It is easy to use with one hand and does the job.  Not sure what else can be said about a capo.  They either work or do not.  The other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that.
ATVYABSTW0LIE_B001PGXIHK,"A little bigger than jazz 3 Good picks but not a replacement for jazz 3 that I still prefer over this one, nice backup in case you run out."
A22SZV0N4O2FQM_B0002D0CKI,"Great pick for all types of rock playing I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick, but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This, of course, can be very annoying, especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto, great for leads, and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost."
A3VG7F7SZUK87S_B005CX4GLE,"Sweet and Simple, Great Price! I just got them (I bought 5) and put them up, so I don't know about longevity. So far, though, they work great and seem to be sturdy enough. And the price is great!I am using them for a variety of instruments including steel string acoustic guitar, classical acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass guitar (4 string), and mandolin. The hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability."
A5O3ZBCOLILKQ_B003VWJ2K8,"Best acoustic tuner. I received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar.  This is the second one I have and it works well.  I have a built in tuner, but the Snark is so easy to use and inexpensive, it is a great deal.  I would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player."
AJGIN15VFGXBG_B000MVYOZY,"great little amp for the price I just can't believe how loud this little baby is. I also have a 180watts Behringer keyboard amp (4 inputs, with lot of FX) but it's a littl heavy to move around.This little amp does everything I need for small gathering. I tried everything as soon as I received it:1) guitar (classic), mandolin, acoustic guitar all sound the way they normally sound in this ampActually, the classical guitar sounds much better and this encourage me to play more thru this amp.2) the microphone, although no reverb or echo, is good enough for singing, sounds as the true voice of the singer3) the MP3 input is 1/4"", which I prefer over the little 1/8"", volume must be controlled by the MP3 player itself4) guitar and mic have separate volume control (we really need it).In summary, it's ready to be used right out of the box.It only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy."
A2MFJ6C67AL015_B002C741B8,Can you hear me now? I bought this for a friend who plays the guitar. He said that you can hear the guitar but barely.
A3M1PLEYNDEYO8_B003B0I09Y,"Nice bright light Nice bright light.  I have the might bright twin lights, and have used them for about 4 years. As with many things, I'm a little older now and need a little more light to read the sheet music.  This light comes in a very nice soft case (though they call it a bag) that holds everything. The switch is conveniently located on top of the light. The clamp is very well constructed and is less likely to move...unlike my twin lights."
A3W2EOWTZVIGC9_B003VWKPHC,"Brilliant design. The design of this product is innovative and excellent.  I haven't used it for as long as I would generally like before writing Amazon reviews of purchased items, and so cannot testify to its reliability, but suffice to say that, for the price, it would be hard to beat.The display is very clear, and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous.  I wonder how I ever lived without it before.For live gigs playing electric, I would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable, as noisy environments probably wouldn't be ideal for this tuner.  This is more for your parlor acoustic setup."
A15TYOEWBQYF0X_B000MVYOZY,"Nice amp for my acoustic This is a nice small amp.  It delivers nice, pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me.  One thing I like about this amp is that it is very simple, not a bunch of complicated settings to worry about.  Another thing, I think it's the nicest looking amp I have and I have about 10 amps now.  It's about the same size as my little Fender Frontman 15 and sits side-by-side with it in my living room.  I use the Fender for electric and the Behringer for the acoustic for practicing.If you're looking for a no frills amp that doesn't cost a lot or take up much room, this is a good one for you.Makes a great little practice amp.  I am totally happy with this one and see no need to add an additional acoustic amp.Mine looks a lot different than the photo, it's more brown and actually looks better."
A3EIML9QZO5NZZ_B000EEJ8IM,its a metal tube a shiney one! Well i got this after hearing seasick steve its cool i havent figured it out just yet but its a very good product
A33LV2M1PAJZ45_B004XNK7AI,"This works and it's cheap on Amazon. I tried one of these on my violin at a Guitar Center where it's costs more than Amazon.I think the Amazon price is the best you'll find.It works as well as expensive tuners. In addition to tuning up the strings, I use it to practice scales on the violin and check my intonation.Be advised though, that it only registers natural notes and sharps. It does not show a readout of flat notes, instead it shows the &#34;equivalent&#34; note. But as violin players know, a B flat is NOT the same as an A#.But it doesn't just read the letter of the note your on. The graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it.For ten bucks, you can't go wrong."
A10HYGDU2NITYQ_B0002CZW0Y,Something Funky Going On I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).
A3MDQTWO6NOV1U_B0002CZUUG,"makes you sound like eric clapton... this is a beautiful guitar...the finish is amazing...and the tone is very clear...if you can't afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul...this is a fun and very good guitar for the money...has 6 strings,,,from e to e...and if you know the g chord you will have lot's of fun...the volume control goes to 11 ,if you want to kick it up a notch...(only kidding)"
A3FUKVX3B48315_B00A270KYM,perfect as always Once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery.have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon. All latch well and look good. Do not fly my guitars anywhere but do carry them in my truck over the road and no damage even with falls along the way.have five hard cases of various brands and all bought thru amazon wirh no complaints with any of them. All fit and work as expected
A3872Y2XH0YDX1_B000J5UEGQ,"Great little mixer This is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home. It's a great little unit. The only set back is that you can not use Condenser mics with this, without an external phantom power supply, as there is NO phantom power on this unit. You need to get the 802 model if you need phantom power, otherwise this will work fine with regular XLR or Hi-Z microphones."
A3UPEG3LRWOX16_B000NJ2TIE,Nice Set of Mics These microphones have a quality-feel to them and they all worked perfectly.  I used them with my Harbinger HA60 PA system and I was not disappointed.  They don't come with cables so be sure you have some available (xlr-xlr).  You can get a 25' cable for under $5 also here on Amazon.  Good deal all around.  Would not hesitate to purchase more of them if I need to.
A1GMWTGXW682GB_B00191WVF6,"Cheap power supply, works as it should. I bought this using Prime and am happy with the power supply. I have many different makes of power supplies. In the end, they are all the same. Proof of this lies in the Boss unit I have owned for 20 years.Amazon had the Planet Waves 9v supply for the lowest price, lower than local retailers and if you do not use or need a &#34;1 Spot&#34; this will not let you down. I may order more to use with some of my older pedals not on my board."
AAON97IT5IHP2_B0002E2XCW,"Fantastic pics These pics are perfect for a jazz guitarist, and I actually like the coloration too.  The Ocean Turquoise wasn't nearly as nice a color and I expected a bluish color.  These are about .7mm and that's just right."
A37A41GWQFMK3D_B003VWJ2K8,"Great Tuner/ Great Price.  gets the job done well this is the 2nd tuner like this that I have purchased.  it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar.  the battery lasts a long time as well, which is not true with all little tuners like this one.  all in all I am very happy with this purchase.  small price to pay to be in tune.  I would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable, inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument."
A3EUD541ZM0R0R_B0002E1G5C,"Saves me tons of time and works perfectly I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough, I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done, this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings, I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves."
A1EQYR35KLTECN_B00923G9Q0,"Used for electric & acoustic guitars Works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help. Comparing it to my old BOSS TU-12 dedicated guitar tuner, this works just as good."
A3CSSZ6U5J4YS5_B0097WDJZA,"Clean power, bright LED's I like this power supply, but I wish that the LED's only turned on for the channels that you have a cable plugged in to, so for that reason I'll give it 4 stars as opposed to 5. The quantity of power outlets and the amperage's that it provides are best in class."
A19SEZVIVAMGVZ_B0002H0A3S,"Great strings I'll be honest, the reason I got these strings is because of the cheap price. I'm a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only. These seem fine to me. Good tone and they stay in tune."
A1VG6TG6LKBPKP_B000BUDO48,"excellent stand for the price This is my favorite light weight guitar stand, simple and does the job.  I try to avoid the stands with lever locking mechanisms at the neck rest which are a pain in the arse when you are trying to switch guitars on the fly.  These are lightweight and collapsible so you can take them anywhere, and are sturdy enough for 'normal' use.  If you're a klutz no guitar stand will be sufficient unless it is encased in carbonite."
A31JRW1DW3SZ2K_B003LTJ404,"Good price, good item A great item for the price. Comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble. You only need to put in the two screws that attach the head to the stand. Each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand. It took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions. It looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands. Its also pretty lightweight and as I said the head comes off with two screws if you want to break it down for traveling. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
A2T305UHZJ21L1_B0002D0CGC,A good Pick I am a bass player so I like my picks to be a bit thicker and wider. I tend to Play with Fender 346 so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this pick worked really well for me.
A3A4UKJUP34E18_B000V8GA46,"New power supply for DR-07MKII is not this power supply I got what I ordered.  However, if I had paid more attention, this is nothing but a standard power supply which I could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the Tascam name on it.UPDATE 5-03-2012 after receiving comments and reading other reviews:I've gotten a comment and have read many comments and I don't know where the fault lies, but this power supply is NOT the power supply for the new replacement Tascam DR-07MKII.  The power supply for that unit is the PS-P515UIf you are unsure what power supply for which model Tascam recorder you have, go to Tascam's website and research it before buying it.The Tascam PSP520 AC Adapter/Power Supply For Mpgt1 is for and DOES work with the older Tascam DR-07 recorder.  I have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered PA head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent."
A1L7M2JXN4EZCR_B000978D58,Good stand and a good price Works great and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence.  Great price too.
A3GEMQFMP0PH48_B002GYWBJ6,Great small amp Wow! This little amp packs tons of tone & sound. Hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully. The  clean channels are really clean & the dirty channels are just plain nasty. 75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off. Lots of bang for the buck here.
A1L2S18BTJE1BZ_B00191WVF6,"My second One Someone snagged the first one, they must have wanted it more than I did. The first one worked great and so does this one. I would recommend this product to everybody."
A36P367G4ZH6Z0_B0002H0A3S,"Full bodied mellow resonance I have restored an old REX Commander.  Yeah, I know;  never heard of it.  Beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck.  Frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing.  But the resonance of the D'Addario's really bring this old guitar to life with a thick juicy vibrance on the bass side, and bell like clarity on the treble side.  Not to mention how great they look.  The snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me.  Terrific strings for the price of cheapies."
AXWEQHTXQWR7Q_B0002OOMU8,"good product old good design. For the price I've bought 4 of them and just put it on all guitars, so wouldn't have to search for pick again"
A1K8E597YAFQQG_B00191WVF6,"Does the trick! This product has a simple function but if you need a 9V adapter, this is the one to get. I trust the Planet Waves brand."
AEHDGUE3L90ZS_B003AM913C,"No More Wire...hangers? I love the freedom the G30 gives me. I'm a real klutz with my cords...especially on the ML designed guitars. So I figured this product would actually end up saving me money over the longrun. The sound is a lot more, there. Between this & the Bill Lawrence humbuckers that the sound is unforgiving and those mistakes will come through real clear...making you work on your technique and become a better player.I took off a star because I don't like the prospect of being a slave to Duracell. I am hoping that rechargeable batteries will be good enough for my needs and I'll give it 5 stars.Side-Note: the 2 foot cord they provide was junk for me. I suggest ordering some better ones."
A33IMLYIVBG5Z4_B004Z17008,"This is a chromatic tuner - no ""ukulele"" tuning mode. I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church.  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;.  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent.  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one.  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone.The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store.  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark.  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need.  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther.  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read.  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are.  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!.Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function.  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off).  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician.  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano.  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes.  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments.The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction.  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark.  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient.  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar.The Snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable, cardboard box.  I have no problem with it, but the Hola! stores better.  I don't really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a &#34;ukulele&#34; setting.  It's a chromatic tuner.  It very well may be sized differently from their other models to fit better on ukuleles.  Other than that, I'm not quite sure what makes it specifically a &#34;Ukulele tuner&#34;."
A2Z7S8B5U4PAKJ_B002UXS4JO,"A Good Boost for Humbuckers This is a very simple boost with a small footprint that fits nicely on the pedal board ... I like the simplicity and the ability to set the dip switches to my liking ... I find that with humbucker pickups it adds just the right, very slight tone coloration that both fattens up the sound and gives it just the right sparkle ... I don't use it much with single coils since they don't seem to benefit as much from the coloration or the treble boost ... it is a good pedal to have on board when you need that little something extra to get the right tone ... built solid ... a quality pedal that should hold up well ..."
A2P3Q65JU68Z5M_B0046A04LU,"Convenient but not very accurate My main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate.  It also occasionally fails to register at all.  I've tried putting in slightly different positions on the head of my guitars, but the contact is sporadic.  I A/B ed the Snark against two other tuners, and the snark fails to show notes that are a little flat and sometimes shows false sharp readings.  The other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear.  Most people like this tuner, and on the plus side I also liked its convenience and the ease with which the results can be read.  Unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch."
A3PGVJF37JSHFO_B001PGXHX0,Really good picks Our teenager really likes these.  As a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers.  Have not broken one yet.
AMGUVF20JAOG8_B0002CZVXM,"An essential item It's worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these. It sure beats fixing a cracked neck, headstock, or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height!"
AZCP5P3BARLS5_B0026RB0G8,Not the greatest You have to get this cap on JUST right or the strings will buzz.  I think I'll keep this as a backup and get a better one for my every day use.
A2GUE6E3DUYX03_B0002GZM00,Connected This is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power.  Its easy to install and keeps things simple.  No more extra messy cabling.  Glad I got it.  Thanks to Amazon for the quick delivery.
ABZYVME9NYCQG_B00646MZHK,OK These tuners just seem OK to me.  I still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner.  The accuracy in my opinion just isn't there.  Still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing.  The price is right.
A1M3XD9UV3PD3I_B0002CZVK0,"Dunlop The Original CryBaby Pedal If you want your guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a BOSS GT-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.

A12ABV9NU02O29_B004TGVRDA,"Fills that void in your pedalboard I could never see myself buying a dedicated compressor, reverb pedal, harmonizer, ring modulator, etc.  The Line 6 M5 seemed like a good way to have a ""jack-of-all-trades"" pedal on my board for those times I needed one specialized effect.  I have to say that it serves that purpose in spades.I have an all-analog board and was reluctant to have anything digital on it based on past experience with modelers.  I was wrong to worry; digital has come a long way.  Almost all of the effects sound great to my ear, especially into a tube amp.  True bypass means no tone suck to boot.High points for the delays, reverbs, and mods.  I am not a fan of all of the drives but the Overdrive and Boost Comp sound pretty awesome.  The Rat model ""Classic Distortion"" sounds exactly like my ProCo Rat2.  Wish I could say the same for the Big Muff model but I guess they couldn't get them all right.The only issue is I liked it so much I could not resist the urge to get the M9 so I can run three effects simultaneously.  However, if you need a pedal to fill in for those times when you need a certain single effect the M5 is a winner."

AG3PVU7DCXZTK_B003DVGVIS,"My favorite picks so far I have some neurological problems with my picking hand, and can't seem to hold onto picks. I really like these Max Grips a lot, and have found that they are excellent for soloing. Great tone as well. For my tastes, they are are a bit stiff for strumming, but perfect for everything else. I love the size and wouldn't want anything larger. The advantage of these over the Dava jazz picks is that if they do move about in your grip, you can still pick with them. The Davas have a rubber coating over the grip part and can only be used on the sharp side. I would say the Davas are slightly more flexible (literally, not figuratively). I use the Dava jazz for more rhythm oriented playing. Cannot recall how these picks are with my acoustic, as I've been on an electric fixation lately.Also a fan of the regular Jazz IIIs and find they don't slip as much as my Dunlop Tortex picks. I think this is due to both the materials of the pick and the raised lettering. Still, in terms of grip, they don't hold a candle to the Max Grips. Both picks have their own unique tonal character.I've tried a variety of picks and I think that once you get used to smaller picks, you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward. These jazz picks are also great for pinch harmonics. They are just a bit difficult to adjust in my hand on the fly because they are so grippy.Overall, these are my picks of choice, for my style, which is blues-oriented. Surprised there are so few reviews.EDIT: The strumming issue can be overcome with playing around with pick angle. It's getting easier with these. I have also since found that while these are fantastic picks, I actually prefer theDunlop Jazz III Pick Pack, Red Nylon,1.38mmdespite lack of the Max-Grip raised lettering. They are just the most wonderful picks I've used. I do plan to try out some 2mm picks, however, as I suspect I'm going to prefer a thicker pick; the III nylons feels slightly thicker than the Max-Grips, which I believe is why I prefer them."

A2J4GBHSDLP4DF_B0002CZVWS,"Kyser Is The Cadillac You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo.  They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do.  The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I don't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well.  You can never go wrong with a Kyser.  Not only that I like the idea that it's an US company.  I've had some cheaper capos and they just don't do the job.  They either don't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much.  This Kyser will last a long, long time."
A37KJ0QD8HYF7A_B000KGYAYQ,not bad from behringer this is what i'm talking about: cheap but very usual form behringer. very handy too. but i hope then would run on batteries next time.
A3OEBPVLF35YQL_B0040ZBI52,"Great for the price - heck, great for twice the price! I have two delay pedals, both inexpensive (this one and a Behringer) and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap Behringer, the Danelectro sounds more natural.  The Behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal, which is perfectly ok for some applications.  The Danelectro has a warmer, almost analog feel.  It sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos.  The case is plastic but unless you eat 3 times your weight at the Golden Corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet, you're not going to break it.  The only thing I don't like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it.  I suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the ""retro"" look of this pedal.  Ok, fine.  I've heard pedals costing twice as much that don't sound as nice as this one.  As one reviewer once wrote, there are guitarists who would rather catch AIDS than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board; I, however, think some of these cheap pedals function quite well, and in some cases, just as well as their more expensive counterparts.  If you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your Holy Grail, OCD, and other ""boutique"" pedals, I promise the other ones won't catch AIDS from this.  In fact, the whole ensemble will benefit."

A3OXHLG6DIBRW8_B002QQC1ZI,"Perfect For My Needs - Highly Recommended This Tascam ""US-100 USB Audio Interface"" is exactly what I was looking for to record from our wireless mic with XLR outputs, directly to my PC video editing software. We professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for ""voice over"" work on existing footage. Before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the PC, so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio. Here are my observations:+ Plug and Play; connected to my PC via USB and was instantly recognized+ USB Powered; no external power needed, a big plus when using my laptop+ Good Sound; clean and clear input+ Multiple Inputs; XLR, 1/4 Mic, RCA stereo line, and ""Hi-Z"" GuitarMisc:- XLR input is not powered (not a problem for us)- Includes ""Audacity"" software, but we did not need to load itHighly Recommended!CFH"
A3D0PD45BHLXFX_B0002E1G5C,"Works well and you can lose it This combo string winder, peg extractor and string clipper serves all three purposes adequately. It fits easily into a gig bag and is light and easy to handle. It is inexpensive enough that I have one in each of my gig bags and cases. In some ways it's like a bic pen, it's cheap enough that if you leave it someplace or lose it you can replace it."

A1HPC4BDRLR60_B004HJ58JI,"A Great Little Amp for the money This amp is a quality item for the dollar range (I paid $49.99).  There is some question about sound quality and variation in quality.  We purchased two of these, and one arrived with some minor issues, constant humming regardless of volume or EQ settings.  Amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem.This is not a 6000W stage amp, nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighbors...it has a full punch output at full gain/volume, and can easily light up a back yard.Specs-Input: 1/4"" Mono (not a tip and ring jack)Controls: Volume/Gain and selectable Volume 3-EQ range knobs.  There are two volume controls, once for each side of the push button selector.Outputs: 1/4"" Mono (for monitor or mixer), 1/4"" Dual Mono Headphone jack (tip and ring supplied from the same mono channel).Power:  Lighted front panel rocker switchThe box is very slim and small, about a foot by a foot and 8"" deep, the rear is partially open, speaker exposed, and allows for cord storage.Pros--Portability, easy of use and set up.-Quality finish (leatherette with steel corners) and good construction, 6"" heavy duty lead guitar speaker-Excellent sound and electronics for ANY amp under $100.  There are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are $30-$50 more.  Go with this one.Cons--Units run hot and cold as to quality, but if it works out of the box, it's good, if not, you'll know it as soon as you power it up. Buy with confidence at Amazon from Amazon and you shouldn't have any worries.These amps power two Squier(tm) by Fender electric guitarsSquier by Fender Bullet Strat with Tremolo Bundle with Strings, Pick Card, and Polishing Cloth - Black, Rosewood Fretboardand do a great job.Other accessories for the beginner electric to consider:Cords -Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft,Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable, 10 feetStrap -Planet Waves Polypropylene Guitar Strap, BlackStraplocks -Dunlop Dual Design Straplok System, NickelHanger -String Swing Hardwood Home & Studio Guitar Hanger (Shades May Vary)"
A2158NV89I72OP_B0040ZBI52,"It does it's job! The delay pedal was inexpensive and it works.  I dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments, but it does the job it was made for.  The case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged."
A3E7O9NSS47TE8_B0002E52RU,"Ideal for Tube Amps! I have a Fender Hod Rod Deluxe, and though it's got the Formel Electronics Mod... still needed a nice touch.This guy filled the need!

A1LHMSY3Q46PJS_B0002D0CEO,"Tortex Picks are simply great I've used everything you can think of in the way of picks and the Tortex are one of my favorites. I have at least 100 of them in various thickness' and these and the Claytons, are all I need. The Claytons are great too, but there are times that I want a different thichness and with the Tortex and Claytons you can find the perfect pick for anything you want to play. They last forever and have a great grip.You gotta try them out"
A3DWQW2L39RB1S_B000068NVI,"Excellent quality, exactly what I needed I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should've known better than to buy. My son, who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money."
A3OJ0RGAECAGH8_B000068O3X,Good Budget Cable These are great patch cables especially for the price. They don't suck any tone they are reliable(I've had mine for 2 years)and are really great for players on a budget.
AN5ISBOQ5U7C_B004FPEF84,Easy This is an even easier sting cleaner than the round tin cleaner that's been around. It's better because it cleans all 6 at once.
A9CQXTVLHQBMA_B0043RZ9QQ,"VOX Satriani amplug This is my 3rd VOX Amplug I have purchased through Amazon.  They are all awesome in thier own way.  The Satriani Amplug has very nice effects similar to a flanger and delay with reverb.  Without the effects on it is similar to the Lead plug with much lighter distortion - still has nice crunch to it though.  If you are a Satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining!  If you could only buy just one, this one may not be for you depending on what style music you like to play.  I love metal, rock, classic rock etc.The first song I played through this plug was 'The Star Spangled Banner' (ala Jimmi Hendrix) and wow, the Satch effects just make it sound amazing!  The Top Gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well.If you are looking for a pure distorted metal sound go for the Metal Amplug - it rocks your face off(I LOVE MINE). The AC30 Amplug is real nice for classic rock and country (it is nice and clean but can go into AC/DC tones) - very versatile Amplug.The Satch Amplug is a welcome addition to my collection...I would tell you to buy it, and if I lost mine I would replace it immediately.  Same with the Metal Amplug.  If I lost my AC30 Amplug I would wait for it to go on sale or something and pick up another -  as versatile as it is, I don't play enough classic rock or country as I do metal."
A3FSC2BQQHFXWT_B000L6GD04,"Great upgrade to your Fender guitar! There isn't much I can add to the good reviews already out there that I read before purchasing these for my 91 American Tele but I will say I really like these tuners and I'm very happy I switched to them. High quality and great design. The guitar just stays in tune now, period. Attractive too with the Fender F on the face of the locking knobs and NOT a big bulky look like I thought they may be before I tried them. Very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar. If your thinking you might like to upgrade to locking tuners but having doubts whether you'll like them or if you should go with a different brand? Go with it and get a set of these! If your experience is like mine you'll be very satisfied."
A20HEID734XSTW_B0002E2XCW,Perfect... I'm working on new strumming patterns and these were exactly what I needed to 'soften' things up just a bit.
A3D38B289R1U21_B000CBE3G4,Good price for effect good price for effect  if your looking for a bit of echo then this is for you.  I have amps that have this feature that due a better job.
AF1I90O6U8VCQ_B0002D0CIK,"So-so I started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing, and it seems to have made my fingertips slick.  So I have a hard time holding on to picks (when I use them) on upstrokes.  I'm sure I could improve my technique and fix the problem, but it's more fun to blame the pick!  These picks were no different from picks without the &#34;gator grip&#34; IMHO.  But Gorilla Snot worked beautifully."
A2ICKZFBMHCMUK_B000EELFTW,"Better design I prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size. Great quality, lasts forever. You won't be dissapointed."
A1JOANG98KBFKU_B005FKF1PY,"As accurate as my $80 tuner but more convenient After years of having a large, awkward tuner I was thrilled to learn about this modest little clip on. So much more discreet to do a little last minute tune up when you're already on the stage.I love that the lights are bright and easy to see, unlike one previous tuner I had that was very hard to read. Dark grey letters on a light grey screen. Even better is that the light colors are different for flat, sharp and on-tune which makes it even easier. May not seem like a big deal when you're tuning alone at your house, but when you're on a stage with other people doing a lot of last minute adjustments and your attention is all over the place, those little details really help.The only real drawback I see in the design is that there is no place on the head of my 6 string acoustic where I can conveniently clip this without it being somewhat in the way of the tuning knobs. Not impossible, but not terribly convenient, either. It was seemingly designed with an electric style in mind where the knobs are more often in one straight line than on either side of the guitar head.The $80 tuner I bought 20 years ago is a Sabine, and quite frankly, 20 years later it still works as well as it did when I bought it. In fact, the price has come down and I bought another one to keep in a different guitar case. Now that I have this one I still use the Sabine more at home, but like this one better on stage because it's low profile. Looks more professional and I like that."
A2IBPI20UZIR0U_B0002F7K7Y,"Get these I've been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels. These strings I have to say, stretched out and stayed in tune much faster than slinkys. They have great sustain and sound nice and chunky. I love the luster and shine of new strings, feels nice ans springy. Since this is my first time with this brand, I don't know how long they will stay good, but we'll see."
A3M9FH2OZKYF4D_B0002DV6RQ,"At last, great strings! I had changed my strings with some new Martins I got recently. They were bloody awful! Luckily, I'd also picked up a package of these Ernie Ball strings. First of all, they were packaged better than the Martins, they went on more easily and after I tuned up, they sound SO much better! Thank you Ernie Ball, for making far superior strings. My guitar thanks you as well (grin)."
AKDQ6O42VUK1U_B0002D070I,"Best going Great pickup, combined with the Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. you will have an excellent experience.  Even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy."
A21DER2RMJIDX7_B003VWKPHC,"Good tuner but some problems... It is bright, easy to attach to my guitar but there are some problems with it being so ""fragile"" at the base.  The battery was a bit tricky to insert since it is so close to the base. I like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic. Be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off. It is very sensitive and has been more accurate than a Planet Waves tuner I currently own. Would I buy it again? I don't know. Going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate. Looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way."
A14Z9LAETO21KL_B000068NVI,"Good Enough Hosa products are a good bang for the buck. I haven't looked up the specifications, but I'm guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG, but since it's only 10' long, it's good enough."
A21DER2RMJIDX7_B0002E2KPC,"Good capo and easy, easy to use! I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar, so after some research online and talking to friends, I bought this capo.It goes on easily,comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside, seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!"
A37KJ0QD8HYF7A_B0016ML1C2,"hit and miss for beringer behringer products are cheap. some of them have good quality both in make and sound. hopefully, behringer will make it even better next time without compromising the price."
A2E5YEDFENFZYC_B008GS9UNQ,"Excellent little tuner Being very disappointing by the sensitivity of the Snark SN 1, I purchased this bargain priced tuner, I could not be more pleased. It has settings for chromatic, bass, guitar, and ukulele. Not only does it have tone dial indicator, but the screen changes color, red for flat, green for just right, yellow for sharp. The screen is also very bright and easy to read. It is very sensitive, no need to constantly move it around like with the Snark SN 1. It is tiny, perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse. I use mine for when I go to the music store and test out ukuleles. This makes a perfect main tuner, or a nice inexpensive backup to more expensive tuners. My main tuner is a Snark SN 8, but this one is just as accurate. The only negatives I can find is that the hinge seems kinda delicate, so you don't want to force it, and the power button is very tiny, but for the size and performance of the unit, those low points are almost irrelevant. Buy a couple, you can get two or three of these for the price of a single Snark or Korg."
AOHR2Q90UXF23_B0002D05FU,"works great for acoustics This polish was recommended in one of Dan Erlewine's books and it works great.  It really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop.  The effect isn't as noticeable on darker finishes though.  It really helps on the back of the neck too, makes it slippery and fast.  Highly recommended."
A14XXL4GMWSI47_B0002II6V0,"Glaesel Violin Mute I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't.  Don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all.  One star, just for it getting here on time."
AQOQUWM58SGFR_B000ULAP4U,"Great first decent pair of headphones First time I've spent over 25 bucks for headphones.  Use for both reference with a GNX4 and guitar, and easy listening.

ACVSCM9GWLNLS_B0002CZVXM,"Good stuff I like this strap lock very strong very sturdy! Keeps things in place.. one problem.. The coating will wear out in a short time (a few months) and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside. This might make it a bit hmm I don't want to say hard to lock, but you'd better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure, Mine has un-clipped a couple times because I didn't check. Our climate is humid so it's rust friendly which could contribute to why I'm having issues. However once clipped properly you shouldn't have issues! Great buy"

A2Y2U697SS98E1_B004Z17008,"A+++ The Snark is great. I have 2 for my 4 ukuleles (so I can always find one),and a 3rd for my guitar. It's not just a UKE tuner. LOVE THEM! And, gavemy grandson a shock-blue one to go with his American Flag painted uke."
A2BRXREMT5WZJ0_B001LJUVO4,"I should've returned this I tried with with my Macbook Pro with both Mountain Lion and Mavericks. Also with my Win7 x64 machine. I tried it with a variety of MIDI capable gear including trying to update firmware on FX hardware, sending and receiving MIDI PC and MIDI CC, as well as transmitting MIDI Clock in and out. I simply couldn't get this to work most of the time. Active Sense used on most Roland products seems to kill it completely.In contrast I purchased the -MU's Xmidi 1x1 Tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time I use it.I should have totally returned this product. Instead it's in a landfill."

A1BW6F3GAM38XV_B0097WDJZA,"Works great, with one Caviaut So ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now. Ive ran different setups and seem to work well with my pedals one at a time except for one issue that I noticed consistently, so beware of this.One channel (#8) does 9v with 500mA, sounds great right?I plug in my Even Tide Timefactor and works great by itself. Once I added other pedals, there became a horrible hum. Like noticable and just horrible. Then I used my stock Timefactor power supply and plugged in my entire rig without drawing 500mA from output 8, and there was no hum.This phenomena also occured when I plugged in my Holy Grail pedal (the classic one) that draws 500mA as well.kind of annoying to have a power strip to power all my pedal, but im not complaining about it for a power supply that is a fraction of the price of a vodoo pp2+, to power most of my pedal quietler than a one spot."
AVF06892OWGJU_B005FIFM14,"What to do with old credit cards This amazing punch can be used to completely obliterate the numbers, and name on an old card, and give guitar picks at the same time. The edges are a little rough, but it is a punch not a precision cutter. One of those soft nail sticks that the ladies carry around work very well to get the rough edges removed."
A24QFMD1RXLJMB_B007PKR3SK,Works for all my tablets I switched over to using an Android tablet for notation when playing music. All of my 7&#34; tablets fit and even my larger HP Touchpad fits. I ended up using an Ainol Fire as my regular tablet. It would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand.
A3775OP5VTX5ON_B003QTM9O2,"Not ideal.  Lower fork too narrow and small, bad design. I bought an Ibanez Concert size uke.  The body is 2 inches wide (less than the 2.75 inches stated for this stand).  My uke does not fit well in the stand.  Why?  The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow, and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke.  Thus, any uke that is concert size or greater.  So, most ukes don't fit well.  They fit, just not well.I did, and you will likely need this advice, remove the bottom fork, turn it upside down, and reinstall it (no tools required).  Now the ""curve"" of it is upward, and the uke better sits on it.  The fit is improved.  Not great but better.  One stand can't fit all instruments, but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars.  This small stand does not hold most all ukes.Although its neat how it folds up, like the video here on Amazon reviews, it is very heavy for its size.  This is not a lightweight stand.  At all.  Surprisingly heavy, and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag, trust me.I wish I got the Hercules standHercules GS402B Mini Stand. All Hercules stuff is superb, and my friend has one for his uke and says it's sublime (I don't own it, myself, so I just present this so you can research it and it's reviews on Amazon). I own other Herc stuff, and it's all ideal, and for a few bucks more, I could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one.  Oh, well, for once, I got cheap.  And got burned for it.All in all, not great, this tiny stand.  One stand fits NOT all.  Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments.  You may think you can bend the lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the Amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all.  It's just an imperfect design. My take on it, your mileage may vary.  Bye bye."
A205483DF7XVDE_B000S5V510,New pedal - SWEET! So far so good with this pedal. Nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activated.I mainly play relatively clean through a tube amp and use this pedal to simply cut through on the leads.I don't use this pedal for searing leads or ultra dirty sounds - just a little dirt - and two levels of it.It makes a good single channel amp act like a three channel amp and so far it is working great!Main amps - 1960 Bassman - 2012 Fender Hot Rod Deluxe - 1957 Fender Bandmaster - these amps sound great with this pedal - I don't use all three at the same time but one of these amps is with me when I play out.This pedal is very versatile and there are lots of good sounds in there so you will probably find something you like in there - but I don't think it will metal very well by itself but it would kick the front end of a good tube amp into another level of distortion pretty good.*****************************************09/27/2013Still lovin' this pedal. You gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it up.This pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds - and is very versatile.I would purchase another if I needed it.Worth every penny.

A9VAK8UG2G5W7_B004FEGXDK,"Yup I agree with the others here, this joyo is just a plain and simple OD just like so many others but at a fraction of the price. I put my pedals through three tests, 1) playing alone, 2) Playing at rehearsal, and 3) gigs. This thing stands up nicely on all three. Using it with Am Sp Tele, Hiway 1 Strat, Squier 51, Epi LP Spec w/p/90 and Fender BJ, Peavey Classic 30/50. Sounds amazing in any combo. Giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth."
A2FFJCRIYMCVCZ_B000E0PPG0,"For the money, these are great! If you have really large or heavy speakers, you might want to consider professional grade stands, but these will work fine for any speakers under 35 lbs. or so (maybe more, if you keep them lower down).  They look nice, and are easily worth their selling price.They do not include any additional hardware for mounting the speakers, so you'll have to figure out what you need, and buy those things separately."
A1CUB195YB9XKO_B004N0MKN8,Great idea One thing tho.  When your guitar isn't in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere.  I am going to be finding picks in my files for years.  Put it up on the table when your picks are not in it.

A2101DHHDMZ93X_B0002F7K7Y,"good strings The D'Addario sets are good stuff. I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker. The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran. With stretching, they stay in tune fine. The unknown truth about non-nylon strings (and maybe even them, too) is that there are only a handful of string makers, and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies (Gore uses them for their Elixir series, and just adds the polyweb coating). I also use the GHS standard .010 sets, and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets, but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes what strings for what companies, though. With offshore production a standard thing now, it's no telling where they actually come from anyways. I DOUBT that GFS strings are domestic production, for instance."

Well no, but  it does slice guitar strings in half and it will pull bridge pins and wind/unwind guitar strings, though.If it had a flashlight, tuner and fingernail trimmer it would be perfect, but engineers are mortal and I couldn't put a tool the size of a watermelon inside my guitar case (at least not without coating it with butter first).Its plastic and steel, it will break eventually as everything does - imperfect world, re &#34;breakfast club&#34; bolts fall out, doors fall off, but til then I'll enjoy using this. The string winder is a little awkward. I have a little fender brand gizmo that looks like a pez dispenser with a swivel head on top, its small so I keep it in the guitar case along with this contraption - winds strings much faster than this device, but if you've got the time this one will work just fine. I also wear two pairs of socks in case one gets a hole in it, I'm prone to redundancies.It may be sheer rumor, but I have it on good sources, that this item is actually based on alien technology recovered at Roswell New Mexico. Your chance to own alien technology at an affordable price not like those I-phones that they took out of the saucers.If it only came in mink it would be perfect."
A2CJVLER896Q7L_B0002GXV3A,MXR 6 Band Graphic EQ Pedal - Great effect! This is a great effect. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. EQ is very sensitive and delivers as it should. I actually believe this will exceed all your expectations. Ships fast. Highly recommended.
A1CKZGG8OQ2DTS_B000EEHKVY,"Hercules GS414B A/G Guitar Stand I've been playing the guitar since the 1960's, so I've gone through plenty of guitar stands.  Always found the hanging-type to be the safest & most secure.  For a long time I was using the Hamilton chrome hanging stand.  When I first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church I attend (Christ Community Church, St Charles, IL), I decided to give them a look.  The build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar (Electric or Acoustic) are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching/ denting.  It offers a very solid support and I feel safe putting my guitar on it.  This is the only type of stand I prefer to use.  I do wish it wasn't made in China, too much of our money goes to that country (just my opinion).  The bottom line is that I am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy, well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever."
A18RGYRCEN181M_B0002GWFEQ,"Best acoustic strap holder anywhere Quick release around the neck strap system. Unbeatable for acoustic, especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy. I would recommend this to anyone. &#8203;"

A1CUB195YB9XKO_B00154OJOI,These picks work fab Picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology.  These pick are cutting edge.  None better.  Possibility created by the multi-flex feature and the grip.  Awesome.  These make me a better player.  I used to have trouble holding on to picks.  Problem solved.  Stress gone.
A2M93TVNC93C3P_B000BNSYHW,Clean smelling Clean really good of prints and smell very nice. My first time using it but like it alot since it works good.
AAPQB8YDQ3RRE_B00352MHGA,"perfect for home studio I have been using this since the day it arrived, it was very easy to setup although windows 8 reads the device as a speaker so the USB does not work for me that way.  It has a great sound and I am very pleased with it."
A2CCGGDGZ694CT_B0007ORM0K,Rotomatics Are Very Dependable These tuning machines are great.They are a little heavier than the stock tuners on my guitars but they help keep your guitar in tune as intended.I needed the tuners replaced on an Applause (Ovation copy) guitar (the bushings fell out of one of the tuners and it became really floppy and refused to stay in tune)and a Washburn guitar. They fit on my Washburn and my Applause perfectly with zero need to ream or drill.The tuner hole size is .391 or 25/64 and of course if your hole size is smaller you must either use a drill or tuner reamer (yes a tuner reamer is a real tool just look at a place like Stewart MacDonald). You may be required to pre-drill for the screws that go through the back of the tuner.It is only one hole and very small.The vendor was quick in sending these tuners but there was no way to trace the package and it became difficult to receive it due to the fact it had to be signed for.The run around at the post office of getting it re-sent was ridiculous.The vendor should try to provide a tracking number so customers can avoid all of the back and forth and have an estimate as to when the package will arrive.
AYTKUTAP0VA53_B003NJF1G8,"Excellent strings, just buy em! Fantastic sound -- just trust what everyone on here is saying -- if you buy these strings and slap em on a cheap ukulele, you will have bought yourself hundreds of hours of playing and fun!"
A27PF2GVKMJSAA_B000PR3JEM,"Excellent quality and precision tuning I installed these on my 2000-ish Epiphone Les Paul.  They provide a VERY noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look.  I can tune with much finer precision, and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending.  The ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better.  I should note that I had to drill new holes or, more precisely, enlarge the holes on my guitar.  I used a 3/8 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully.  I'm sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary, but it was actually quite easy.  Now they are in there nice and snug since I made the holes a bit tight."
A3FW4THIMBIN6V_B0018SJLFS,Seems Fine to Me Tone is subjective. I have little experience with tube voodoo. So all I can say is that it is working well for me. I would buy again.
A2Z548GT5948WH_B0002E1G5C,A Handy Gadget It cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand. It is very solid and will last a long time.

I use it boost my jazz bass to the same volume level as my precision.  It does the job perfectly.  The LED is REALLY bright, which for me is a good thing, but others might find distracting.  Also, it would convenient if there were external switches instead of internal dip switches for varying the settings, but in such a small footprint, there are bound to be tradeoffs. I'd buy this again for sure."
A3AT69S9R8ZWGT_B0002GZLZQ,"One Spot Adapter I choose this rating cause it is the best Adapter I've found. I like that is doesn't heat up or even get warm although I only use it with my looper. Another plus +++ is the length of the cord is the best cause I don't need to use and extension cord with it. One less thing to set up, carry around and worry about. I Truly recommend this One Spot Adapter to everyone."
A2J4UAF6RW13WK_B000EEGAJW,Great picks for guitarists at any level I love these picks. I buy tons of them all the time. If you are like me and prefer to just strum tunes on your acoustic then these are the picks for you. I prefer thin picks for basic strumming as I am a beginner guitarist and they are more forgiving.
AYJJDQQ4EZ5V3_B005FKF1PY,Very small This unit is very small and tucks away nicely.  It is easy to use.  I do wish they would make the bracket a little stronger but it works well.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Very Nice!!
A37A41GWQFMK3D_B003VYBD58,Works as it should. very portable great for carrying with you.  works as it should.  good price.  I would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot.
A2CCGGDGZ694CT_B00AZUAORE,Great Pedal I can become VERY creative with this pedal and do a good many things in a great many settings.I have other musicians online who jam with me and I can really do more than a handful of things in showing them where I am going with a song.So many things I have developed.Great tool and good quality product.
A29XLZLRNBWBZ8_B0033P1O6S,"Banjo great value, good quality and sound. Very pleased with this purchase!  High value for low $$ risk. You will not be disappointed."
A3PGVJF37JSHFO_B009O7CE5O,"Yep, works even on a flute Well, without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes, usually in the lower octaves, are a little off.  With cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised.  This tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes.  The fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars.  Highly recommended.  And it looks great too."
A2E2CJWPL1YMAR_B003VWJ2K8,"Quality, Easy, Perfect I had never owned an electronic tuner before, but have used the large models and the iPhone apps.  This is a great product.  It is easy to use.  Adjustable to virtually any stringed instrument.  I haven't banged it around, but have had no problems with durability.  Bright, easy to read display.  I would highly recommend this for beginners to pros alike."

AGH6UUAIAZLMB_B000UMFQHA,"12AT7 in the PI spot I bought this tube to test in a friends Fender HRD in the PI spot. He wanted more clean tone and was willing to have less overall gain. He liked the result when I switched out the GT 12AX7. I want to try a JAN 12AT7 next, but the JJ is doing a good job for now. Also interested in swapping out his GT (Sovtek) 5881's for JJ 6L6GC's."
A3CSWB0L9ZLD94_B0002GZLZQ,"It works with no added noise! I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment. Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy. I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version. Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle.I've owned it for a couple of months, used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times. Zero hum or buzz from the unit. I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board."
A110ZEDSNASVCO_B0002D0Q2W,"Five Stars Without Hiss or Hum Originally I purchased a Behringer EQ700 equalizer pedal for my rig. It was cheap at around $20+ some change but like the other reviewers noted, it's noisy with hiss. So I took the advice of another reviewer & bought the Fish & Chips model by Danaelectro and it's terrific.I plugged it directly in line on my SKB pedal board, turned them both on, turned on the amp, put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max & no discernible hiss nor hum. Mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable.This pedal has a cool 1950's style & appearance. It has a great punch when you raise up the Level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar & amp sounds. For a modifying pedal, you cannot go wrong for the $30 price tag. If you're in the market for a great 7 band EQ pedal, then you'll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one.This product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars."
A2HBAYOAKSXIY2_B0002KZIVY,"Just What I was Looking for! I got the aged white. I was changing out pups for a more vintage sound. This kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one. I have a MIM 2012 Strat, every thing went together with out any issues. Best price online and the shipping was super fast. I back plate is the mint green, but looks awesome on the guitar."
A18X90KMZ6KZ3H_B0026RB0G8,Great!!! I was skeptical because of the price but these work great.  It is even large enough to use with my 12 String.
A3H4S6YO9VNGDZ_B0002F7K7Y,"Like 'em...Don't Love 'em These strings are okay, but nothing special except for the price, which is a factor when changing twice a week. I don't play enough to need changes that often anymore.So I've become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar. This doesn't mean that these strings are bad, it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because they're darker and Brand Y Steels on another because they're brighter and Brand Z on yet another.So give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least, if you want your instrument in top shape. A bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good."
A3394J1F9CN9W5_B0002GXPRM,"Mic Clip... not much to it! it does what's it's suppose to do... holds a mic, pretty much what you see is what you get... works very well."
A3M05N9UWHIXUI_B0002GXF8Q,Good mic covers not much to say about foam.  They do the job well.  You can't go wrong.  I would recomend these to anyone and they are cheap.
A2IDOKLAT1MP8X_B0002CZV82,"The go to distortion pedal This is a distortion pedal. It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. It's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in, but it's a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted, and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS, so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing, but word to the wise, don't pay more than $40 new for this thing."
A2IZ3ST24HSO4H_B003DVGVIS,guitar pick w/ extruded grip nubs exactly what I was looking for. A Jazz III- sized pick (smaller than a common-sized guitar pick) that works better for me because the grip nubs make it easier to keep it in the proper angle/position
A1CL807EOUPVP1_B003VWJ2K8,"Something for me. I've heard about the Snark tuners before, and have seen them once in awhile, but while skimming the music side of Amazon I finally picked this up...and it works GREAT!"

A1P11QY9RR3IA7_B0002GOJZO,They look cool These look so neat that my brother and I both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last Christmas. Unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play.
A2FIYNFKZQXGWO_B003DVGVIS,Love to thickness but too small. I had no reference point to judge the size of these picks perhaps compare pick with a quarter in the shot as a sizing method.Good picks though.
A13A81NN0NRD1S_B0002E3DLM,"seems great for both acoustic and electric Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster.  Solid unit, good material and construction, though it is made in China apparently--but hey thats why its such a bargain!"
A2VGVG7IFBRSML_B003VWJ2K8,"Great Tuner, very convenient This tuner gave me problems at first because I did not know how to use it. You have to attach it to the guitar in order for it to work, which is pretty cool. You don't have to hold it or put it on your leg. Also, this is very accurate and gives only a slight range to be in tune. It is a  great product."
A26NQIGPSFBU5Z_B003B01QR2,"Greaaaat picks! These things are so great! I get sweaty hands when playing so the slick celluloid picks were wanting to slide in and I'd have to keep dryin off my fingers and adjusting the pick. With these I can play anything without having to worry about the pick goin anywhere. The .88 thickness is also ideal for just about any sort of music since you can chug some heavy riffs and go up and shred without any hiccups. Very nice. One thing yo note is they like to cling to each other, so if youre using one of those little pick holders when you pull one out they all want to come with it. but not that big a deal. Definitely recommend these if you're sick of picks slipping out of your hands!"
AQFOCVEBDCYU9_B0000AQRSU,jazzgryl52 no complaints here! the quality is great! the sounds is excellent! and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp. use it all the time.
A1L3H6SSKSRNGV_B002024UDE,"GREAT This violin is AMAZING considering it's price, I got it for my girlfriend, expecting it to maybe be a complete joke and be absolutely worthless and it wasn't she went to a violin school and people had payed waay more than me and had a violin that sucked. I am a satisfied costumer, for a beginner or if you want a cheap violin to practice till you destroy it, this one's for you.Basic but sturdy, gets the job done :)"
A1SD1C8XK3Z3V1_B004U1QDL0,"excellent tremelo I purchased this pedal recently, a bit skeptical with such a low price tag; however, I was completely impressed with it. I don't use a tremolo effect often, but when I do I just need some subtle, shimmering swells. This box does the trick. Construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis. The knobs feel sturdy enough and the button seems strong - by the way, it is true bypass which is nice. It doesn't seem to affect my tone when I kick it on, no volume or tone changes, just the tremolo effect. And, silly enough, the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board. I don't know if I will purchase other joyo effects, but I am impressed with this one. 5 stars."
A36OSNJ4YJSGEP_B0002E37MM,Very Disappointed!!! Only Lasted 2yr.  I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it.
A1KO6FM2PGCYC8_B002C741BI,"Was a waste of money The fact that it is passive really kills it. I just could not get any sound out of it, I tried multiple placements. I finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it. Not worth the money, or the extra hole in your guitar."
A29B4PAIOL7HYG_B00IZCSW3M,Nice strings I usually use Gibson Vintage Nickle Strings on my electric guitars but when I had an opportunity to try theses strings out I jumped at the chance. I put them on a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop guitar with P-90 pickups. I had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed. They had some great &#34;spank&#34; and sounded great. Easy to play (they almost seemed thinner than advertised - they play like 9's but sounded like tens). I am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the Gibson strings. Next I want to try a set on a Strat and see how they sound - I suspect they will sound and play great!
ASJAKT8DJIAC5_B0002DV7U2,"works great and easy to carry I have two of these stands, the electric guitar/bass version and the acoustic version. Back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case. Yes -- folded up it WILL fit in my tweed Fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar (I DO always keep it IN the included stand bag to ensure I don't scratch or bump it against my guitar). Great at this price too, buy several!"
A52REIMRM97HV_B0002F7K7Y,"Good Price. I love these strings and the price too since I like to change them every time I do a modification to my guitars. Every couple months I change something making ""Upgrades"". They sound Great and stay in tune well."
A3E7O9NSS47TE8_B000V4YFLA,"A No.1 Classic! I use this guy with a Fender Twin, since Overdrive sound is not enough for now a days metal. Not much of noise and practical carry. If you really want to go for something a bit more &#34;Marshall JCM900 like&#34;... get a MXR Custom Badass '78 Distortion. For a extreme... get a Riot!"
A2NIT6BKW11XJQ_B000BKY8CU,"SEAT CUSHIONY The Keyboard Bench is lower than I anticipated.  The seat is very soft and comfortable.  However, it doesn't appear to hold anyone with excess weight."
A2FCEH4VOA71GU_B003B01QR2,Great Pick This is my go to favorite pick especially for strumming. I Love the added level of control the grip surface gives me.
A1IL0PS2XJB4NS_B00B5OY8EE,"VERY impressed! VERY VERY loud electric guitar amp! As a bass player, I was shocked that 40W could be that loud for guitar. I can't raise the volume above 1 in my house. When you switch it to acoustic or bass mode, the volume decreases dramatically, but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionally.Excellent top quality features. Beautiful sound for each of the different modes. The acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar SOUND like it was an actual acoustic. The amp simulation is top notch.Awesome value for the price!Edit: I've played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settings....I'm even MORE impressed. One of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero. I brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and BOOM....huge sound. I play with a 18 piece dance band and usually bring my Hartke kickback for that group. After experimenting more, I would not hesitate to use the Peavey for rehearsals and performances with that band.I still can't get over the fact that it is a 40W amp. The sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage."
AAGD3GA9ZVPLQ_B0007GGUGA,"It's how a capo should be. I've tried Kyser capos and they're good. They work. This capo, however, just works simply, smoothly, and it's a great pleasure to operate. Like a Seagull vs a Taylor 8 series, they both work, but one has more beauty in its being. Made in China, designed in Europe, slippery, a bit heavy, but still very, very nice. It's more money than I'd have liked to have paid, but I'm glad I did. Did it improve my life? Not at all. It also didn't improve my guitar playing - but somehow it's just so much nicer to have than any other capo I've used."
A2Y2U697SS98E1_B00F2PKRJW,"YUK! I really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! They went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. Save your money. We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now."
A23HJIRA5PIMG0_B0006GR4L6,"Nice Wide Axe Holder Very nice leather strap, I will like it better when it is worn in, and softer, but excellent for holding the weight of a five string bass.I very much recommend it, along with some Dunlop straploks."
A1N82BBPB5816P_B0037M62KA,"great strap nice strap, i meant its just a basic strap, so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far. should last a while with good care."
ALVO1A5UB8DG0_B0002E1G5C,"Works well I like this string winder, and it is convenient having the wire cutter there too, but the &#34;bridge pin puller&#34; is too small, and doesn't work on my instruments.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of five."
A2JMJVNTBL7K7E_B008BPI2HE,"Best capo I've ever had Can't say I've tried all of the capos in the world, but I've had my share of the different designs.First I had the bungee cord type, then I had the snap on type, then I had the different capos designed for acoustic, or classical or electrical.This one by far, evolved from good design.The bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly. The top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings.  The spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension.The design on this is so that every string receives the same vertical pressure down to the neck. All of the others I have tried use a spring that could pop out (one actually did) and the entire capo came apart.This one even has a pick holder built in.It is light weight, just the right size.I highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar."
A1OZ7F08MNF320_B0002E1G5C,It winds and cuts :D i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break strings.hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands.
A2RS66Y79Q8X0W_B001QWBM62,"Great field recorder I own both the H1 and H4n and I love them both. The H4n is a great versatile field recorder. I mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements. The H4n is a work horse. It has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats. I highly recommend purchasing a ""furry head"" wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door use.Unlike the H1 design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones, the H4n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications. However, be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped. I had this happen once. If this happens to you, don't worry. I searched the internet and was able to find several Zoom certified service centers within my general area. I called the closest service center, spoke with a repairman and shipped the H4n off and the mic was replaced under warranty; I didn't pay a dime. I had it shipped off and back in 7 days.All in all the H4n is a great field recorder. I mainly use it in 4 channel mode. 4 Chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two XLR inputs at the same time. In some cases I also use a small 4 Channel Behringer field mixer if I have to run more than 2 lavalier microphones. Running straight from the mixer outputs to the H4n works perfectly.I do suggest some accessories when using the H4n. As I said earlier, purchase a ""furry head"" wind screen. I use the furry head wind screens every time I record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise. I only use 32gb Sandisk SD cards because Sandisk is dependable, I have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording. I record at 48K @ 16bits in .wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so 32gbs is large enough to record over 20hours at that sampling rate. This allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case I forget to transfer the audio files along with video when I edit. I also suggest having a DI box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone else's mixer. I have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a DI Box from venue mixers. This has to do with a balance and padding that I am just not going to get into but trust me, a DI box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues. I also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than 2 microphones when at live events. Always be prepared. I use rechargeable Duracell AA batteries and I have never had any issues. Battery life is between 6-8 hours when the unit is left on, and 3-4 hours when left powered on and recording.I do not regret this purchase at all. The H4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable. I highly recommend purchasing one."
A35HTG0YUEKFGM_B005PGGU9O,"It works and should last Not much you can say. The headline says it all. It works well. Shipping takes time but for the price, who cares. If you need it now, go local but if you have time to wait, this is perfect. I ordered two just in case. But it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all."
A3DDG0WH5SBF34_B005IVUWDG,"Good basic slap delay pedal This is a very basic delay pedal, with the obvious knobs: delay volume, time and repeats. It has a nice bright sound, never too muddy and it's perfect for some Dave Gilmour style slap back delays.It only works with a power adapter, no battery. This has its pros and cons: on one side the pedal has a smaller foot print and costs less, on the other side if your power adapter breaks you're out of luck!Unlike many similar pedals this one doesn't let you set infinite repeats: this makes it impossible to make tricks a la Johnny Greenwood like creating quick loops and changing the delay speed to obtain weird noises. This is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals, so I returned it. Nonetheless, the product itself is great: cheap, sturdy and it does exactly what it's supposed to do."
A2EQ8GHKXEF141_B0002GWFEQ,"Excellent product I was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar. I did see this device on amazon.com and I decide to buy and try one. I was pleasantly surprised with this ""Guitar Quick Release System"" is working good with my acoustic guitar. And because of that I did purchase 2 more for my other guitar and for my friend one."
A195EZSQDW3E21_1384719342,"It Does The Job Well The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it."
AKSFZ4G1AXYFC_B000165DSM,"Works as it should; for the person on a budget I use this cable for small home recording projects. I do not take the cable around to gigs or shows, as I am pretty sure it wouldn't last longer than a few months of heavy use. The sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy. If your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job, this is your product."
AL8K7SWTLZ12X_B000CBE3G4,"This has that Old Tube Amp reverb Sound for a great price The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-4 Slap Echo effects pedal works great and gives me that Old Tube Amp Reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit.  There's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all..  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."

ATJQOAUHB5XB8_B0002IHGZC,"Excellent I bought pedal power 2 in order to use on my latest board build. This works perfectly and is actually fairly small for a power supply.

AR6CAR106LX2Y_B004FPEF84,Best String Cleaner This is the best string cleaner I have owned to date and I have owned about all of the rest. The way it is packaged makes it super easy to pop the lid and apply it. The casing is tough enough to be thrown into my gig bag and carried all over without the lid coming off or the case breaking. The 'other' string cleaner that is a bottle with cloth applicator spills out and the cloth wears out too fast - then leaves cloth pieces on the strings. This product does not waste the cleaning agent - it applies evenly and there is NO cloth residue left on the strings to pick off. The cleaning agency works so well - it looks like I have cleaned a BBQ grill when I wipe my strings down. Amazing how dirty the strings get after just a few hours of play - this product will get that gunk off. I am done looking for a better string cleaner because this product has the best cleaner in the best packaging for travel. Well done Fender!
A2CJVLER896Q7L_B003DVGVIS,"Best pick ever! I have tried many picks in my 25+ years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best. I have been using Dunlop for the most recent years, but these are the best. The Carbon Fiber of these Dunlop Jazz III make them as long lasting as you want - when playing rock (slides and picking) they are better than any other material, and still very comfortable for softer rythms and styles like blues or jazz. Their grip is excellent and they feel awesome. Gotta try them! Highly recommended. Cheers!"
A85AE6BNHXAXR_B0002E1J5E,Heavy retro sound I was loking for a particular sound that I jsut couldn't find with lighter strings. This set was perfect and I was able to re-create the sound Iwas looking for.
A3G6P4SJ8SYH9F_B0037M4CPM,very nice strap. I can use this strap with either smooth or suede side on my shoulder.Actually I like the smooth side on my shoulder so it is easy to adjust position without pulling on my shirt.

A2H5GRB3XXEBX0_B000VBH2IG,"Awesome recorder This is a fantastic little recorder, but not for $300.  I bought mine used for $75 on a bass player's forum in the classified section.  That was over 3 years ago.  It has recorded almost every show I play, which is about 2-5 gigs a month, plus a couple rehearsals.  I record for my own learning purposes, and sometimes to make very rough demo's (some audio is better than no audio!) and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do.  The interface is not perfect and there is a little bit of a learning curve with the settings, but if you use the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) setting, the recording level is taken care of.  I use Audacity to amplify when necessary, to normalize always, and to edit from .wav to .mp3.  Its pretty easy and I am no sound tech nor am I a studio engineer.And if you goof and unplug it before powering it down, no problem.  Just pull the SD card out, insert in to your computer, save the files on your computer as .raw files by changing the extension (but first make a copy of the original file so that if you make a mistake you have a backup) and import the file into Audacity as a .raw file. From there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as .mp3 files."
AF331KJH45RIH_B0002D0CGC,"Dunlops These have been my favorite picks, for decades now. They grip very well, and last forever, and they're a tiny bit more muted than other, more &#34;plasticky&#34; picks."

AMTQJ1ZZ58BO4_B000RW0O02,"A Must Own for British Tube Amps BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: If you play an Orange, Vox, or Marshall, you don't necessarily *need* an EQ pedal, but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next level.Why is this? Well, the Brits design their amps with wide and musical EQ but the overall frequency response is narrow. This has led many British amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that British EQ isn't as dramatic as American guitarists want it to be. There is nothing wrong with this by any means - it's just an overall characteristic of British amplifiers.Secondly, any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel - since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly. This pedal is more than capable of providing that boost. +15dB seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty, or dirty to overdrive, or overdrive to distortion.LIVE PERFORMANCE: If you're in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs, you've probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bass/midrange noise (100~500Hz) that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter. Applying EQ to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low-end from the picture and boosting your high-end for better clarity.RECORDING DIRECT-IN: If you're using this pedal with a DI box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping, you'll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your Strat or brighten your Les Paul.WHY 4 STARS? Yes, the noise. It's not bothersome by any means, but if you're recording with a mic'd amp or direct in, you will absolutely need a noise suppressor. I use my GE-7 with the BOSS NS-2, and the NS-2 completely removes the white noise generated from the GE-7. The result is an amazing, clean boosting EQ.IF YOU'RE ON THE FENCE... go ahead and get this thing. You won't regret it. It's not just for Tone Snobs, it can really make cheap gear sound way better, and take great gear to the next level."
AM9EL9YBP070A_B0002GJ6FC,"Works well, folds neatly. This little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work. It folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases. The rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table. It may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you're not careful. Sure, a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose, but what else would you spend the $10 on?"
A6M441DQ7HL09_B003VWKPHC,"Condolences for mine Stopped working all by itself. Fresh battery didn't help.Fortunately, I've another, plus a Korg and an two Intellitouch. (I've 2 fiddles and 3 guitars)The Intellitouch is simply ""champion!""."

The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black, silver, gold, and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home"

ADH0O8UVJOT10_B004OK1G64,"Warm, tube-like overdrive/booster with voicing you may or may not like I recently picked up the TC Electronic MojoMojo Overdrive at a steal of a price, but I'm evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price.  I own many different overdrives, including light overdrives in the ""Tubescreamer"", and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous (Blues Driver, OCD, Joyo Ultimate Drive, etc.).  To me, this is closer to the Tubescreamer family, as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive.  Actually, the separate knobs for Bass and Treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the Digitech Bad Monkey.BUILD QUALITY - Outstanding.  It has an ""MXR"" style click button press, but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last.  The 9V jack is on the top, out of the way of the I/O jacks.  The battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screw/button that you can easily get open with your fingers, or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver.  The thing is dense and build solid as a rock.  I always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crush-resistant, and tend to get punted around by your cables.  Finally, the 4 knobs are built will with some force feedback, and several of them are actually notched to settle into the ""12"" position, which is a nice touch.TONE QUALITY - Obviously, the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review.  I would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a ""5"" and absolutely loved it, as several previous reviewers did.  But based on the pedals I have used and my experiences with the MojoMojo, it feels more like a ""4"" to me.  The tone is very warm, almost to the point of being muddy.  Whether the mod switch is a ""boost"" or a ""cut"", the pedal is bassier in the ""up"" position.  Don't get me wrong, I definitely appreciate the abundance of low-end frequencies, but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through.  I could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments.  It does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character.  However, if you'd like a similar effect with a much more expressive (and brighter) output, try the Mad Professor Sweet Honey Overdrive, or its ""clone"" companion, the Joyo Sweet Baby Overdrive.EASE OF USE/VERSATILITY - Many overdrives only have the single tone control, so I was excited to see controls for Bass and Treble.  Still, I feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps, and very muddy with others.  I will update my review if my feelings change, as I have a few different combinations I want to try out.  I feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion.  This is much the way you would use a Tubescreamer.  I will say that it is one of the more ""tube-like"" overdrives I have tried.  Hit the notes lightly, and you get a clean, transparent tone.  Attack them harder, and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup, much like a tube amp.  However, if your hope is simply to plug into the MojoMojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones, you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal."
AZ0LJNEP2VRD1_B0002CZVBE,"A gem! I have several overdrive pedals, some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1. For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals. But when I went back to trying the SD-1, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using. I don't mean merely that it's ""very good relative to its price""; I mean that it's ""very good--period."" It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more. The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on Amazon. At that price, it's an amazingly good deal. Note: This is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself). If you want to ride the crazy train, look elsewhere (like Deltalab's Metal Distortion pedal). What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive. It's excellent. It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus. I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amp's chorus; the result is delicious. I've used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups. Both sound good, though, not surprisingly, you get a heavier punch with a humbucker. But it sounds great with single-coils too."
A3HCK3UXD6WS4G_B0002H0FMO,"Good strings I bought these strings to replace the strings on my Hofner acoustic. The gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone. I might try a lighter set next time, but these have a good clear tone from low to high, and are fairly comfortable."
A2YQTEPCGZ5N7J_B0002KZIVY,"Decent overall, except for backplate Back plate has a ""greenish"" tint, and is single ply, not 3-ply as advertised.Color wasnt as advertised, its more of an ""off-white"" than a vintage cream. But I guess its close enough considering the price.Shipping took far too long. (Not sure if Music123 or USPS is to blame for that, but Id go with USPS)Besides those minor faults, the items fit well and look good.My 2006 Strat now has the look of a '57, without the huge price tag."
A342XAA3YXGKT9_B0002GLDQM,Does the job so far. Nice little device.  We'll see how long it lasts (a cheap little plastic thing really) but so far it does the job and holds about 6 or so medium picks easily without issue.  I use it with the medium dunlop picks.  Glad I got it.
A2RVY2GDMZHH4_B003HGFRO8,Tremendous improvement Such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz.  Makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes.  Worth every penny mind you...  Does require some length and height adjustment for some Epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put..  So far so good.
A1YR3RVSBZK8CW_B0040ZBI52,awesome!!!! for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal.use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though. it just does the job and im more than satisfied.it works awesome with electric guitar too. just get it!
ADH0O8UVJOT10_B000RNB720,"Terrific adapter solution for medium-to-large pedalboards This is a terrific product.  While the price might seem a little high for a power adapter, it actually serves the function of what you might need several other adapters and daisy chains to accomplish.The key to the OneSpot is the 1700mA output.  By comparison, the Boss PSA-120 adapter puts out 200mA.  Since most stompboxes draw between 5 and 60 mA of power, you could only reliably chain up to about 3 or 4 of them with the BOSS adapter.The combo kit is a great value because it comes with a daisy chain for up to eight pedals, and some other parts for hookups to a 9V adapter or other jacks that I don't use on my pedals.  I use it with BOSS and Ibanez pedals and it works great.  Best of all, there's no added electric ""buzzing"" noise, which is a problem with many budget power solutions.Also like how the cable hookups are angled instead of straight - makes much more sense for a tight pedalboard.  No more 9V's and no more hooking up multiple cables every time - one simple plug and I'm ready to play!"
A1JNNQAUI5FZV_B0002D0LKY,"slippery and young Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price, why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product, it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
A202CZ4PJH83G4_B002G1UT5C,"So this is a Large size? I did get 5 thumb picks in my order (a previous reviewer mentioned only getting 4), and I always really liked the classic turtle-shell look (far more purty-like than the plain, thick white of Nationals and others).  But these are large? And, yes, I double checked the packaging to ensure I was shipped large. The National mediums I was using before had a looser fit -boggle-.  But nevertheless, the Planet Waves' far tighter fit actually feel better than the National mediums, which certainly had a clunky sensation; there is probably a small weight difference between the two that would explain the overall feeling of quicker movement while having good solid interactions on the strings.  All in all, 4 stars.  Still... these were a large?  Hate to see how the mediums fit."
A8E9VWP5EQH6B_B004Z17008,"Easy Reader This is my third Snark tuner, I keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear.

A00625243BI8W1SSZNLMD_B0009G1E0K,"Great product! i ordered with my new guitar. These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here."
A2SH4497XM1HET_B0097WDJZA,"Great power supply I admit I haven't had it long, but so far so good. I have a Gator pedal board that came with their power supply. Unfortunately, that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable. The PS is fine, but the cable is shorting out. Couldn't find another cable, so I thought I'd find another solution with a more generic cable. This Joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition (which made me a little skeptical). I may never need all its features, but for what I need (powering 5 devices) it is doing the job beautifully. My pedal board includes tuner, chorus and octaver stomp boxes, a bass DI and a Rolls headphone amp. The JP-02 frees me up from any other wall warts. Money! Now I just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board."
A2WT46GVYE1ZDD_B0006NDF8A,Mine is for my banjo And works well for it. My only concern is that the shaft that holds the weight is plastic and not metal. I don't know how long it will last. I might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole. But the price is right and the stand is solid enough. All areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last.

I've been playing electric for many years, but this was my first acoustic purchase. Turns out I have the ""Dreadnought"" variety, which is a bit larger. This Fender bag received some great reviews, but I was apprehensive about having to return it if the dimensions weren't correct... I couldn't find ANY info on the web about the interior dimensions of this bag, so I took the leap... and I'm so glad I did!

It rocks, pun intended.Bottom Line: Every guitarist should have one. No excuses."
A1LH6RF4UN9VI6_B008BPI2HE,"Works like a champ, even on Ukuleles Oh, quick note: this capo is meant for instruments with radiused, NOT flat, necks.  That said, it works fine on a non-radiused ukulele.I've been using only Kyser capos for many years now.  They don't fall off, they don't usually pull strings sharp, but they do grip TIGHT and can damage some finishes.This capo is easy on & easy off with the pistol grip, has a correct supportive shape for the back of the neck so it won't damage finishes, and has adjustable tension.  I backed off the tension as much as possible, set it on the neck, made one adjustment and it was perfect.  Since I can adjust the tension, I have no worries about it pulling strings sharp.I only wish it was a bit shorter for Ukulele neck widths! ;-)"

AZ0LJNEP2VRD1_B0002CZVHI,"Superb This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals. Further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good, but the BOSS takes the prize. I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets."

I wind long-scale bass strings onto my unusual super-short-scale 26""-scale, six-stringed bass instrument, so I'm betting I get more use out of this thing than about anybody. This device is much easier on my fingers and hands and much, much faster. The cutter worked great, too. Changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore. Can't ask for more than that."
A2Z3FDWL7DQD76_B0002E1H9W,"you can buy this with your eyes close, you wont regret the purchase the best thing I've purchase for my guitars this year , I'm not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning , the 01 and 02 are the best, restore the live of my fretboard, the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine , the only one that I've just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don't play with it after the cleaning ,but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner.you can buy this with your eyes close, you wont regret the purchase."
A4XWMOFB1HY04_B000B6FBA2,"Great capo There's nothing not to like about this capo.  I have two of them.  I've played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos.  I like this one's low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard (by turning a knob to tighten it) rather than rely on a spring, as on the clip-on type. It takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip-on type, but I like the results better."
A21V6HGU6SU4JG_B000BQTCDO,"smooth, rich, saturated wall of fuzz This pedal does exactly what my title suggests... it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz... very smashing pumpkins feel to this. It doesn't do many different tones, but what it does it does very well! And frankly, once I find a good tone out of a pedal, I don't change it often anyhow! This is an amazing value, and a welcome party of my pedal boards. (P.S.: I have the Russian variant...)"

When picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck.  I will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings."
A3DPGV307X2498_B0023BYDHK,NOISY. Pros:- Price point- Does the job in the descriptionCons:- Shielding of USB cable is abysmal; very susceptible to interference (could work if there is minimal circuitry around where you use it)- Cheap plastic construction
A34LQ791ACZ0JC_B000MVYOZY,"Good Amp For The Money I was a bit skeptical about buying this, but after reading the reviews I thought why not. It is actually a good little practice amp. I'm still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood. It gives me the portability I needed to move about my house. I was using a mixer that's hooked to one of my PCs and using that sound card for sound. That works great, but sometimes I don't want to be tied down to the PC. I use the PC arrangement for recording and the amp for private relaxing guitar playing wherever I want to have it. I recommend this little amp wholeheartedly. Just be mindful that it isn't a $500 Marshall amp, but it does well in a pinch."

A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN_B000Y35C8S,"DD5 Clone on the cheap ! Pretty much a straight up clone of the Boss pedal- and a decent one at that. Not the bulletproof construction of the boss to be sure, but all the functions are the same. This is not true bypass but neither is the Boss. I have not experienced the tone-suck or buzzing that others have complained about. Mine worked flawlessly out of the box and does a great job thickening up my leads in a Gilmour or EJ way. Is this the best digital delay on the market? Surely not, but it's the best cheap one. The pedal features up to 2 seconds of delay and a tap tempo function, however the instructions do not tell you how to engage the tap function(hold the pedal down). Believe me, you figure it out at this price point. If you want to spend double the price ($70- still cheap for a delay~), I would suggest the Ibanez DE7. Incidentally- this pedal- like any other digital delay or digital reverb- will EAT batteries. It's what they do, and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal. Invest in a daisy chain (SPOT or the like...) If you have a pedal train with multiple stomp boxes and you are running them via 9 volt it's a no-brainer."
A2Y4PRG2HHOL3G_B009MBT68U,"Out'stand'ing! This will last a very long time due its sturdy construction. Two pieces, easy to set up in seconds. Great buy for the $. (...ONLY MINE WAS A 'HAMILTON')"
A1WJBJUQ24G8BU_B002DC8OE2,"Love them--special niche These strings are so soft to the touch that they almost feel like ""flat-wound"" acoustic guitar strings. When you uncoil them out of the wrapper they don't spring out like most other strings but sort of flop out like a string string instead of a wire wrapped in wire. They sound wonderful but I swear the feel easier to play and I was doing things with them I usually am pretty clumsy at with my mitts. They won't last as long as coateds of course but they have a depth and a character all their own worth checking out and you may find, like me, that it's worth going back to changing them out every few weeks to get the fresh sound. If you're really an acoustic guitar aficionado, you'll want to try these. The almost play themselves IMO. And that makes me want to play twice as long."

A3BTH66WVCQAM9_B0002H0A3S,"Yep these are my go to strings. I can now say I have used several others - coated Martins, flat wounds, smooth wounds, EXP, Elixir, etc. These are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks. Their tone is slightly bright but not as &#34;harpsichord&#34; as the EXP. I am done experimenting. These are the strings for Takamine guitars."
A35P0LNBJ0WUPL_B000PO30QM,It's what was desired Not too much to say about a cable.  It worked out of the box...no shorts or noises. The jacket on the straight plug was partly unscrewed and that's a continuing problem with these cords.  I use some thread-lock on them.  I find the right angle plugs useful for lots of things.
A2A039TZMZHH9Y_B000OY707S,"It's OK Neither delighted nor disappointed.  I have not found it to be intuitive to use and the battery compartment is a joke, but otherwise the construction is good.  I dont use it very much because I havent really figured out what I want to do with it, and it is too big to fit in my briefcase full of blues harps, so I have the behringer A/B switch doing the job there."
AOY459LVUBKLO_B0002E1O2M,"Nice tone.... Time will tell if they last longer than strings 1/3rd the price. Visually, they don't appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings. I was expecting something different, but as far as sound goes, the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune, even after playing &#34;smear notes&#34; on several songs. My problem with cheaper strings (De'Angelo) was they would tarnish or rust quickly, the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar. The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer. I'll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not. Since these are literally triple the cost, I'll know if it was worth the extra expense. Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America. Good or bad, once I see the longevity of this set, I'll add to this review at that time."

A24JW33E1DW64K_B0002DV7ZM,"Great stand for a great price I have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars. I have 4 classical guitars, 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string.  It's very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over.  It's a really great, quality stand for the price.  They don't take up a lot of room and they're very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if you're traveling.  I highly recommend it.My guitar teacher suggested that I keep my guitar(s) out because he said that if I kept it/them in a visible, easily-accesible place that I would practice more, even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right.  Instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags/cases after each practice session, I have them all out and displayed and I definitely practice and play more because as soon as I step into the room - there they are, I just pick any one of them up and start playing.  It was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but I hadn't realized that I always had the excuse that I didn't have time to practice -- but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesn't take up a lot of time, for some reason kept me from practicing.  I guess out of sight, out of mind.  But now I keep my guitars out, and I also bought a music stand and I keep the music I'm working on and the stand out.  Yes, it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful."

A3SDJ70H00OQCJ_B002Q0WSO8,"Finally!  Amazon offers the Intelli IMT-500 The Intelli IMT-500--The tuner that killed the Intellitouch!There are scores of chromatic tuners on the market.  Most work by using a small built-in microphone that picks up sound waves.  In order to be used effectively, the tuning space must be relatively quiet.  Many of these tuners have input jacks that allow electric guitars to be connected directly and tuned by the electronic signal they produce. A bunch of years ago a variety of clip-on-microphones began to be marketed.  The microphone could be clipped to any instrument and its cord attach to an electronic tuner.  Now, anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noise.Then, the Intellitouch tuner hit the market.  The entire tuner clipped onto the instrument.  One could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment.  There was no cord to deal with and the instrument could stay clipped to the headstock or quickly removed and slid into a pocket or case.  Talk about convenience.  Jams and festivals (bluegrass, folk, whatever) became seas of Intellitouch tuners.Intellitouch owned the market even though there were so many situations where they did not work well. In particular, they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars. The more overtones an instrument produces, the worse the tuner behaves. The bass string of a Martin rosewood dreadnought was near impossible to tune without using one of the many workarounds that owners developed.  So, it was very much a love-hate relationship.  The shortcomings were huge, but the convenience meant that they were tolerated.Then, came the Intelli.  It was an Intellitouch that worked, if not perfectly, then a whole lot better.  The amazing thing is that the switch from Intellitouch to Intelli wasn't gradual.  Within six months of its introduction, jams and festivals became seas of Intelli tuners.  People were throwing their Intellitouches into drawers (if they weren't lucky enough to find a die hard holdout willing to buy one second-hand) to get the Intelli.  That's a considerable investment to abandon.  But, why not?  The Intelli is half the price of the Intellitouch and works a whole lot better.  They are so inexpensive that it's easy to justify getting one for the practice area and one for the case so that you don't have to worry about forgetting to pack it.Anyone who will ever have to tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment will quickly find this tuner indispensable.  And it works darn well in a quiet environment, too!Highly recommended!"
A26SN2CVQM4FKM_B00B5LDMH6,seems to work just fine for me... although im not onstage bouncing aroung...they hold the strap on just fine...no changing hardware like strap locks...yes..more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice...but i will order more..
A28X8QQ97HM6CX_B0007ORM0K,"A very worthwhile upgrade! I bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my Hondo II ""The Paul"", which I bought in 1980. The stock ones were loose, lots of backlash in the worm gears, and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new.They went in easily, if you follow this hint( if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged, disregard this hint)- The holes for the old machine heads on the Hondo II were 0.305"" in diameter, and these new Grovers need a 0.390"" diameter hole. So I had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes. It's almost impossible to use a drill, even in a drill press, without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock. I read online suggestions about using a round wood file, and reamer, etc.. So what I did was first use a threading tap( for metal screw threads) which at the bottom had a 0.290"" diameter, and at the top had a 0.375"" diameter. This is a standard 3/8""-24 threading tap. I chucked the tap into my battery-powered hand drill, set to low speed, and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to 0.375"" in diameter. Then I used a tapered reamer, from both sides, to enlarge the holes to the required diameter. Quick, clean, easy. If you have a different size enlargement to make, use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to 0.390"" diameter.Another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time, like when changing strings. You don't want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod. At least I don't want to!Now the guitar stays in tune, and is easier and more accurate to tune.A very worthwhile upgrade! Zero backlash in the worm gears on the Grovers, beautifully chromed and smooth as silk."
AB7WPLA1CN5I1_B001ELP5WM,"Does the Job! I love it.  It works great.  No ambient noise or clicks, as some have suggested.

Just buy the product and get on with happy music making.  Thank you On-Stage."
A9RAHOMYAQB51_B001W99HE8,Great knock off of a shure 57 I own a GLS ES-58 and am very happy with it so when I need a mic for my guitar cab I went with a GLS-57 and couldn't be happier. These mics are very solid and I can't tell them from the real deal. I have done side by side comparison of both the real 57 and knock off 57 mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak I doubt you would notice any difference. I am about to purchase three more of these 57 mics for the rest of the bands intruments.
A1NAA1R38JSNHV_B002GYWBKU,"I love this thing! This thing works wonders. If you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot I recommend. I hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels, and this just is perfect for the job. The pedals are all easy to press and I love the volume/wah 2-in-1 pedal. I just use it as a volume, because I already have a wah pedal. The tuner works amazing as well. I also love the fact that it connects to your amp via RJ45 ethernet cable."

A24JUT24W1K3CV_B0002GMGYA,"Great Quality Cable I own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them. I use this particular length cable for patching various pieces of audio gear in a rehearsal space or for plugging into a direct box on stage.The ends are solid when connected and the cable material itself is very 'slinky', i.e. not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to be.And a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price."
A1SDGIC08LD6BW_B000PO30QM,"Good cable I use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp. I do move it around plug and unplug it often and after two months of daily use it works as well as it did when it was brand new. I was initially concerned when I first received the cable that it would not last. The cable is not as fat as I had hoped, however the ends are solid and sturdily built. I usually use Mogami Gold cables and do so because budget cables are crap and only last a month or so, if that long.  This Hosa Cable is a very good cable and I even chose to use Hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals. They last."
A17A1KTVI3DG6U_B0002E3CHC,"Good strings, good price I like them, but these strings are probably not for everyone. The EXP16s do provide a crisp, bright sound almost leaning towards metallic. This tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow-bodied Ovation. However, I have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different.While I was not expecting it, my favorite aspect of the EXP16s is the playability. The play is a little more elastic than I thought it would be, and they are amazingly easy on the fingers.The only downside that I experienced with the EXP16s is the fact that, while giving once on the guitar, they are a little brittle off the guitar (I almost snapped my E getting it set up). Other than that, the strings are just a little squeaky. I personally like a little squeak, but at the current price point, I don't think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don't."
A1EWYZI4ZHU9XZ_B001G3TJXO,"Voodoo Lab power supply didn't fit as advertised. My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. However, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. The fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. There's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. I wasn't worried about this, since I doubt I'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. Once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. You'll probably have to break them. It's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this. Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. You can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, I wish I could return this board - except I can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)Basically, I paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. Needless to say, I'm not very pleased."
AE9C0UNXBV8CB_B005FKF1PY,"D-Addario NS Micro Clip-On Tuner (2 pack) I purchased a couple sets of these to try them out.  They are small and unobtrusive digital tuners which can be left attached for easily keeping your instrument in tune.  They seem slower to lock then my Snark tuners, and the visual scale is not as precise, but they do seem to work fairly well.  The ratcheting mechanism holds tightly on my guitars, and they can be stored in the case attached.  Its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it.UPDATE:  Downgrading my rating by 1 star.  Having used four NS MicroTuners for a couple of weeks, on four different instruments, I have to say that, in comparison to my Snark tuners, the NS Micro Tuner is slow to lock, and difficult to tune precisely.  With the Snark (any of them...I have several models) I can usually pluck a string once and tune the string in seconds.  With the NS Microtuners, I have to repeatedly pluck a string, and the tuner is slow to display the adjustment.  Sometimes I have to pluck a string several times before the NS Microtuner acknowledges a string has been played at all!  It is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target. |E| would be a perfectly tuned ""E"", but one of the side indicators is always flickering and getting it perfect takes patience and repeated effort.  I still like having them clipped to an instrument for a quick check, but when I want to be precise (and fast) I always reach for the Snark."

I also have a Carvin and two Paul Reed Smith guitars that came with locking tuners...they are certainly worth having. Fenders (at least American-made ones) are very easy to swap out tuners for these...the holes are already there, there's no need to drill holes for screws, everything is so easy you have to do it yourself. I've swapped out the tuners and have never looked back...the only question is what to do with the non-locking Fender tuners I have now!"
A1YURS42Z635HR_B000V4YFLA,"MXR does it again. This is another in the MXR ""Distortion"" line. The Distortion III has a more overdrive flavor than a high gain pedal like the Boss Metal Zone or the Barber Dirty Bomb but is very flexible. Not really for heavy metal (see the MXR 116 Fullbore Metal) but more for that AC/DC and classic rock sound.There is a lot of gain on tap from the output section so it is possible to hit the front of a tube amp hard without turning up the distortion. The tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useable.The good thing about this pedal apart from the price is you do not get that ""fizzy"" top end that some pedals have when you crank the distortion. In addition, the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knob.Pedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly."

A34IJACMU8C3IM_B0000AQRST,"One Half Of Shure's Long Lasting Dynamic Duo Considering that the SM57 was introduced to the world in 1967, a year after the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone, I guess the 58 gets Batman status, relegating the 57 to that of Robin. But that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically.The SM (Studio Microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc. In that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the SM58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. So the SM57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at.One of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House. A pair of SM57's is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kitShure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kityou can buy for this exact type of use.The SM57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse. That's one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies. And on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price.There is a Performer SeriesShure Beta 57A Microphonethat looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. So make sure you try before you buy.Bottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced. A best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians."

A2SKZZZBV1XYWP_B0002D0CGC,"Simply great picks. OK, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However, I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
A2BZQNBV8UDZ2C_B0002H04NE,"Can't beat the value I keep going back and forth between DR High Beams and these. My teacher really likes the High Beams, but these are half the price, and the tone is just great and, surely a new set of these are going to have more &#34;oomph&#34; than a set of High Beams I keep a little too long because they cost more. . .  Recommended."
AC2S76UKUPIL4_B000NJ2TIE,"Buy them at 39.99 I bought them at 45 dollars. Use for small music gigs and DJ/MC uses. They are great for DJ uses or other things where the quality of the voice isn't so important, as long as you can be heard and understood. I recommend for use of: 1. Small music venues (smaller bands), Djing, public speaking, band practices/rehearses, etc.For higher quality microphones at a reasonable price, look at the Audix OM2 when it's around 80 bucks, or Audio Technica products."
A1S8R9OAIQT7YI_B001J5RYXQ,Great look and play for an intro electric. Great for a beginner electric.Needed new strings but everything else was smooth.Pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well.
A1HJ1H7EIPFBRK_B003VWJ2K8,Great lil tuner I had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s*** im gonna by me one lol
A37U8NH2CD9EDX_B005NACC6M,"Purchased for amateur field recordings I purchased the DR-40 for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs, and it accomplishes that very well.  The battery life is great, the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it, and the build quality is pretty solid.  My only issue is the internal mics, while crystal clear in terms of quality, can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things.  In addition, they are VERY susceptible to wind, even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air.  I highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery."
AIAH54R6EL4V8_B008GS9UNQ,"Great little tuner at a great price!!!!! Great little tuner very accurate and portable!nice bright screen perfect and the price is right!Its nice it has a chromatic tuner on it too as wellas guitar and bass too! very handy! i useit to tune my baritone, concert and soprano ukes !"
A26M5O53PHZTKN_B0002H02IG,Love this product I love this cable. They last for ever and NEVER cause buzz or noise. These are the only ones I buy now.
A2BB6IKKR4G40J_B000T517Y4,Sounds like a muff but theres a good reason why its cheaper I am a tone freak. I bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff. At the time i had never owned a big muff. I thought the sound it produced was big muff sound. I later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff. The difference was huge. The big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box. I later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging. I am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal. I would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space
AWKVQQZKTRFAL_B005H2007E,"Not bad Great deal for the price. Works fine, but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric. Did the job for what I needed. Now I know I would love a better one like a Fishman."
AB39UO500J4EP_B0002E1NQE,"The more you play the better they sound I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
ALHC64J88LVWO_B000068O4H,"Can't beat it For the price, can't beat it.  Works as well as any $15 - $20 one I would have bought at local guitar stores."
A2PN3GY7I3EKC1_B000068O1N,"Just the right product, just the right price When you need an audio insert cable, you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs, such as mixer cases with processing gear, it's simply not cost effective, and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands, but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation, while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product, Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price, Amazon!"
A18C03TA8N26L4_B000AAGM0M,"Good tuner and metronome I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs. I just miss the ""mecanical"" click of a mechanic metronome. The rest is just great. i've bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better."
A23NSKTMSPPBTR_B001V5K2S8,"Nice inexpensive bag This bag was nicer than I expected for the price. Considering that many soprano ukuleles are in the $20 t0 $100 range, a lot of people won't want to buy a hard case for three times the price of this gig bag or for more money than their instrument cost.The case is better padded than I might have expected for the price. Since soprano ukuleles are small and lightweight instruments, it's not clear to me why a hard case would be as important to most people as it might be to somebody evaluating guitar cases, or cases for other larger instruments.If you have a small child who is likely to sit on the instrument or drop it down the stairs constantly, you might want to consider something better. But this should provide adequate protection in general, even from minor falls. For a soft bag, this offers all I would ever need."
A1HR4TQ0HAGU8T_B000SJJCX4,"Perfect for at-home use. This is not a gigging pedal. You do not have time to tune with this pedal at a gig, so if you're planning on gigging in the next month or so spend the $50 on a Korg. However if you're an at-home player who just wants to not have to mess around with regular electric tuners, this is worth the price. It sits right on the pedal board, the signal flies through it when it's off so there's no monkeying with your cables everytime you want to switch between standard and Drop D, and it's as accurate as the Korg is. It's just also slow. It takes a good 2-3 seconds to register a change, which is fine when you're just practicing or even for recording at home where a few seconds aren't crucial. I just recommend something a little faster if you need to tune quickly between songs."
AU9RL6MBM25YY_B0002H0A3S,"A personal favorite These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine. I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use. I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers, or put undue stress on your guitar. Not only that, but they sound great. Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass. I love how they color code their strings on the ""ball ends"". To me this makes it much easier when changing strings. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands. Give these a try. I think you'll be satisfied."
A1N82BBPB5816P_B001FB5Z44,"great case great case, didn't really notice a smell that everyone was complaining about. holds my seagal s6 very well. great guitar by the way for the price. but anyways the case has some compartments inside that can fit like tuners and accessories which comes in handy. the padding is done very well"
A2H5GRB3XXEBX0_B003VWJ2K8,"Snark is a great company I am editing my earlier review.  I bought 2 of these about 6 months ago.  One works just fine, no problems whatsoever, I use it on every gig and at home.  The other has some kind of short in it.  It drains batteries almost overnight.  When I take the batteries out, no problem.  Tunes just fine, but I am sure over time the battery harness will break as it is made of flimsy plastic materials that surely will not stand this kind of test.I contacted Snark and Marcy, their customer service rep, sent me a new one free of charge even though the tuner was out of warranty.  Excellent customer service!  They have earned my loyalty even if their products are not perfect because their service is!I will edit this review later if the replacement turns out not to work perfectly."
AFB7MSIPJIW68_B000CCIVCA,"Good value Idiot-proof, compact, extremely sturdy. All metal enclosure with good quality jacks, simple to understand LED readouts. Runs on 2 AA batteries.Features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperPyle-Pro PCT10are:-'Test tone' function which sends a known volume signal down the line. Very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment.-'Intermittent' issue indication - This is what made me choose this model. If there's even the shortest dropout, the LEDs indicate it. Intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot.My only complaints:-The a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries. It was like carving a bar of soap with a knife. Quite frustrating. Used my Dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw, and managed to get it out.-There's an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back. This clip blocks access to the battery compartment, which is ridiculous. Luckily I have no need for the clip. I used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw.-No rubber feet on the bottom + metal enclosure + battery cover screw = sliding around and marring whatever it sits on. I stuck some re-purposed rubber feet on the bottom.After the few 'problem solving' situations mentioned above, this thing is a 5 star product. Too bad they couldn't go the extra step to make it 5 star out of the box."
A1GMWTGXW682GB_B0002CZVA0,"Versatile pedal for distortion, but not the best. This is a great pedal I picked up used, they can be had cheaply on the used market. I actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit. The 2 EQ pots on the front panel make it very versatile, enough to use with a cigar box guitar also.The pedal can preserve bass signal and still be EQ'd for saturated distortion. The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular. I also other Boss Distortion pedals. Like most people, I own a DS-1 and an MD-2 which are both cheap and effective. I own a HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone.I also own an older 80's HM-2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with, overall i like this pedal, but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals."
A2VXKVJV7KIGMD_B000RNB720,Great Accessory I have this hooked up to 4 Pedals so far and it's awesome. Real cost saver on batteries. You really cant go wrong for the price.
A1ZQVN0F0FURHH_B003OG9NH8,nice sounding reverb with a few quirks sounds great.  Love the sound of this pedal but a few quirks.  It does not work well with a daisy chain power supply.  with this set up the second channel will distort a bit.  Forget batteries. They last 5-10 minutes.  With its own power supply sounds amazing esp when one takes in to consideration the price
AKAVVQMXSAIGX_B0002GWFEQ,"GREAT solution for acoustic guitar I've been using these on my acoustic guitars (and straps) for over a decade.  They're sturdy and convenient, and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap.  The ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage (or when you don't need the strap hanging from your guitar, e.g., sitting in a chair) works exactly as advertised.  I've purchased several of these and can't say enough good things about the product and company!"
A1BNFL98NKJNYA_B005PGGU9O,"Great product Nice product, I like the great feel as the handle angle is large and makes it very easy to remove."
A4BTCECGQAIUI_B0002IAJ56,It works It works really well and it's really thin. It's thinner than i thought. The price it's about right. I needed only 3 of these but since if you buy one at the time is more expensive than to buy the box i got this.
A3I23DPVLDXAB2_B00389KMQM,"Fender Bass guitar strings. Who would have thought you could buy ""quality"" bass guitar strings from the same place you can buy your DVDs?The strings are, with out a doubt, real Fender strings. And even with shipping coasts they are STILL comparably-priced if not cheaper then buying them at a nationaly franchised music store.But...Because you don't have the opportunity to compare strings; I do recommend that you know what you want.I've also purchased ""top shelf"" guitar stings, as well as a variety of other products, from AMAZON and have ALWAYS been satisfied with the qualiy and service."
A2W7M00WSI4JND_B0002M6CVC,"Rusts in a matter of 2 days these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, Ernie Ball strings are garbage, the only time I will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh,  you can spend 4$ for a set of Ernie Ball or D'Addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months,  It doesn't make sense to use these crappy Ernie's unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars,"
A2WZWY5MQTXO0R_B002AQNGIU,Put them on all your guitars If you play a lot you have to install these on all your guitars and straps. Easy to use and very secure. No fear of the strap coming loose and having your guitar drop to the floor.
A121QRWXZIO6UP_B000B6FBA2,"Loving it! This is a fantastic little capo.  I say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type, of the Shubb capos I've used.It has a low profile, and I can reach right up to it and still play well.It seems to be sturdy and well constructed, and I love that I can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings.  Just enough so they don't buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is off.Much cheaper than the G7th, and does the job just as well in my opinion.For everyone saying that you can't fit it on the neck, make sure you get the right capo!  If you have a classical guitar, get a classical capo!  If you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo.  If you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks, get the normal one.Don't write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind."
A1GOLQ90G6MHK6_B0002E3CHC,"good guitar string i've used many brand for my guitars for years. this one is very good, long lasting guitar strings. balanced tone as it says on the box and special coating system makes strings last longer than non-coated ones from lusting. easy to install and use, and very reasonable price. thanks amazon for this product sale."
A29XLZLRNBWBZ8_B00A716FB0,"Cheap Zippers Returned this item because the zipper was already broken when I received it. Not durable! Spend a few more dollars, it is worth it."
A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA_B0002GLCRC,"Does the job, but use a base support to protect the neck Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas, but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks, depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood, really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest, but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward."
APH7O58XJXKPT_B000L7MNUM,Mighty Bright Duet Music Stand Light Works great. I use this thing several times per week in rehearsals and it always does the job. My only critique would be in battery life; maybe a different setup (it uses 3 AAA batteries) would provide longer life. Otherwise it's great-
A1EMTRDX5PBNCP_B000A2HDXA,"QC must have been asleep the day they made these! The C has the same numbered base plate top and bottom, so the numbers are totally opposite on each side. I see what people mean about the taste, but that's hardly a problem as I knew what I was purchasing. Overall, reasonably satisfied, will give them a good try later."
ABC68JUCPTVOE_B000068NW5,"Pretty cheap cable that has lasted so far Zero issues with this cable so far.  It feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in, unplugging, and packing between practice spaces.I'll update this review if/when it breaks."
A3IVULXGE2PB43_B003GEBGA0,"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I just received this mic today and tried it out. I purchased it after rave reviews from other Amazon purchasers. This is a heavy solid high quality mic. Are you kidding me at this low price. They giving it away. Heck, the microphone cable it came with his heavy duty and long and it's worth $10 all by itself. I recorded a song today with it and I sounded very clear and clean with no hissing or popping.  You can't beat this deal. Awesome nice mic."
A21GCOGHDQNHQS_B000OY4WA6,"Exceeded all expectations I was looking for a small, high quality monitor for use in the Praise Band at church. I needed to run my Boss GT-100 and vocals through it on stage. This little speaker is more than loud enough for a good size stage with reasonable stage volume. It is built extremely well/very solid and sounds incredible. The volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing. I still chuckle when someone asks me to turn my guitar up and I do and all this sound comes from this little speaker sitting on the floor. There is a threaded mic stand socket on the bottom, but I place it on the floor and angle it back by putting my DI box underneath it. Between this and my GT-100 I have the ultimate direct guitar system, with inputs still available for a monitor feed from the main board. Simply fantastic piece of equipment."
A2JK2ITE138P7Z_B0033PSLSM,"Takes some getting used to I got this at a great price so decided to give a strobe tuner a try. If you're accustomed to vibration tuners it takes some getting used to it. While it may technically be more accurate than the cheaper vibration tuners, this advantage is of limited use given that the tuning of guitars still has to have some compromise from perfect in order to be well intonated. One advantage over the clip on tuners (by the way, you can't beat Snarks for the price) is that because it is electronically connected to the guitar it is not affected but other instruments that may be playing at the same time. I've noticed that while trying to tune when playing live by clip on tuner seemed to get &#34;confused&#34; by other instruments."
A280VP2CL6ZFZZ_B003B01QL8,"Tone I use these strings for my Telecasters and I have to say the tone is wonderful, beside they last for weeks without turning a different color because of the use. Very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar."
A1ZYV05OSO4QZK_B0009FUUO2,I was origianlly disappointed in the sound I didn't know how Pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps.  I was origianlly disappointed in the sound.
A1E5FQZTUM8OC1_B0002DV6RQ,Sound is lacking These just sound flat in comparison to Elixir Nanowebs and they don't feel as good either.I guess I just prefer coated acoustic strings.
A2N4QZ92NBKJZZ_B004UJO41S,"... angled it toward the ""G"" string and it sounds great. What a buy for the price I put this in the soundhole of a concert ukulele and angled it toward the &#34;G&#34; string and it sounds great. What a buy for the price. You may have to experiment with position and for ukes some have found the headstock to be the best spot. Whatever spot you find is best for you, it's worth it, I'm going to try it on my reso-uke next."
A3UXW18DP4WSD6_B005CX4GLE,"great works out great for my two Ukus,,  hung it on the wall, looks good and is easy to adjust etc."
A37A41GWQFMK3D_B000068NW5,"gets the job done I am not hard on cables.  I typically just plug them in to my guitar, dont move around much, and play for an hour or two a day.  this one seem to perform just fine.  no buzz, and/or other noises noted.  I have several of them and they have all performed well."
A1VU51HBF6KIYB_B0002DV7U2,"Good stand but not for a mini guitar The fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender / Squire mini guitar. the guitar falls through. I will have to buy a differant stand for him, rendering this one useless. The fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 3/4 size ether."
A355HGZDEPHHC5_B0002GJ6FC,Head stand For those of you who change strings on your guitar or mandolin or just about any other string insterment this is a must have.Holds up your insterment while changing strings-- your insterment doest slide around on you. and it folds up. keep it right in your case. very cool tool to have  Thanks
A1MH7LD4Y203Q5_B00A270KYM,Fits like a glove it is more than I hoped for! Very nice protection for my Luna! it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat!
A16Z3HTUIYPDH8_B0042EZH6W,"Get a tube Great little amp, but get a tube amp if you're serious about playing guitar. It will sound a lot better and it's not too much more expensive. Solid state just isn't the same.I'll also say that it's quite difficult to get a natural sound out of this amp without a lot of tweaking. Even then, you won't get a great clean tone. The Fender Champ X2 is a great alternative to the more expensive and desiralble vintage Fender Vibro Champ. Go with Quality and save yourself a future purchase (resale vale is great on the X2 as well)."
A5ZS85C5V40S8_B000VBH2IG,Excellent overall value! Excellent Sound quality.Very functional and easy to work with.Small enough to take along.It is my most used Gear in my life right now. I don't want anything else.
A1MV8LXEXO8EWC_B002PMHAVS,"Good Little Tuner for the Money I ordered this tuner so I could carry it around with my ukelele in a gig bag.  It's worked fine.  I've used it to tune a ukelele, a bass, and a guitar, and it works fine on all counts.  I have no complaints about it."
APB6VJX5CNR5C_B000KIRT6A,Great EQ! This little guy does all it needs to do. Once plugged into your board you can litterally ballance yourelf in the monitor without worrying about the sound guy.
A5SRLPK9A3LG_B008BPI2HE,Works as promised This capo is easy to install and move and does not seem to pull the strings thus maintaining tune. Adjustment is easy and effective. The same company makes a tuning capo which I find handy at times.
A14XXL4GMWSI47_B001V5K2S8,"Lanikai Gig Bag This gig bag is well worth the price.  It replaced the cheesy gig back I received with my soprano ukulele, and I have much more faith that my instrument will be much safer now.  It has extra padding on the bottom for when the uke is standing up, and has a pocket in the front for tuners and other small odds and ends.  Get this gig bag!"
A1L7M2JXN4EZCR_B0002GLCRC,Good wall hanger if you want to hang a couple guitars Works great.  I didn't use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws.  Next time I'm buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so I don't have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars.  For now I'm hanging one on the wall with this and it's fine.  Wood is nice quality.  I notice the price is almost 2x as much if you walk in the guitar center.
A2BHAEL2Q4HR4A_B0002H02IG,"Durable and clear sound I've been using this one for about a year now, with no problems. I really like the durability and clear sound quality."
ACY9QYNDFLVBI_B001UJEKZ6,Great cable.  I have been pleased with it. I use this cable to run from the balanced XLR outs on my digital piano to the balanced TRS inputs of my audio interface.  It works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it.  I am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone.
AOCBJFQ7UPEOJ_B008GS9UNQ,AWSOME!! This is so darn cool!! It shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune!! And it works on so many instruments!!
A3SUC2DJYHUU9Y_B007T8OGLK,"Works okay. This device sounds okay, its usable. But you should plan ahead if you're in the USA and want one, it ships from mainland China, it takes a while to get to the States."
A26RLGZUUENC6E_B005M0CK9M,"HARD NOT TO GO BALLS OUT Put this through an AC30C2 and prepare to be amazed. Never owned an OCD but I don't need to. My neighbors I'm sure are not pleased. Many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point! It's your guitar on steriods. Crisp deplication of it with bass, treble and a little hair on it. That's at the 25% gain setting. Flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls. From nasty blues to Steppenwolf you will have it covered."
A396ELNTQDFYPO_B004XNK7AI,"Not on my bass I bought this to use on my Fender P-bass. It is not reliable for me, sometimes it works and sometimes it can't find the low note correctly. I'm still using my Roland stomp box tuner. Glad this was inexpensive, it was not worth the hassle to return, i gave it away."
A23AKO4BZLZ8DE_B0002E1G5C,"finally after 3 years I have been asking for this for 3 years now, and someone finally got me one.  Nicely built and very handy to have when changing guitar strings."
AJ3MI4QT7339J_B000CCJP4I,"Chorus pedal is right on!!!! fast delivery, works perfectly...I have 3 of the Danelectro effects pedals... hard to say which I prefer most cause they all have an individual and distinct sound...I'm partial to the chorus ...good item"
A1LHMSY3Q46PJS_B000BWEM42,"Well built folding stand great for guitar music and tab I bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books. This stand works great for me, and hold even the largest of my music and tab books.The construction is much better than other portable stands I've used in the past, and has two great features that I really appreciate. One is it's height adjustable, and two is the tilting head. The tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad, and this one works great.For the price this stand is a great buy that I would recommend to anyone, but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional. With the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make."
APEJ8EJCC8PQ8_B000VBH2IG,"Materials are the tradeoff for great price and performance I also own an Olympus LS-10.  This gives me the same recording ability 96/24 but it is much less expensive.  You do get the ability to record with four channels which I am dying to try once I get my hands on 5.1 encoding software.  Also nice and not included with other brands, A tripod to hold the unit, a handle to use the unit like a microphone, charger, and earbuds.Some have noted the zoom doesn't have speakers built in.  If you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it.  You need monitors or quality headphones.  I find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments.As I said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material.  Olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls.  This may be a big issue if you don't treat your equipment carefully.  Time will tell, but I have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money.I am also looking at the Zoom H1 which will come out in Sept. 2010.  This product may actually be the LS-10 killer."
A3872Y2XH0YDX1_B000J5Y282,"Great mixer for the home recording enthusiast! I bought this to upgrade from a Eurorack 802 that I had. I'm quite please with the Xenyx 1202. Lots of inputs, phantom power, and it produces really great sound! I'm very happy with this little mixer."
A3AGHEETVTCBQI_B005M0CK9M,"Well worth twice the price! The Joyo Ultimate Overdrive is simply a great pedal. Tone adjustment is precise. The bright switch is an added bonus. Having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal. Construction is first rate and there is absolutly no hum, hiss, loss of signal, nor any excessive coloring of your signal. In short you get 100% drive that has a very broad range to work from. Through a tube amp it just extends the sound to levels that were not possible using the amp's gain alone. Impressive! I can clearly see why so many have stated that this pedal is so good. It just is. I'm not one to argue over perfection, and neither should anyone else that plays guitar and cares about their tone and gear. This one is a winner, hands down!And I'm not a new player either, been at it for nearly 5 decades now. I know tone, and have had great, and not so great gear. This one is a keeper! It handles everything from easy overdrive to nearly all out metal (not a metal pedal though) but it gets that drive from those huge amps of the 70's right on the money. Versatile. Smooth. Easy to dial in. What's not to like here? Forget your ""boutique"" pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal."
A3SU1JZBMQ5ABZ_B0007L8BQW,"Initial tests went well Bought this as a back-up to my AT system and have only tried it in my living room. Home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although I think I hear a little distortion if I turn the gain up too much (I don't think you can change the gain on the AT system). My only nitpick is that I'll need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a 1/8&#34;. For the price, it's amazing. I just hope it works in the field as well."
A13A81NN0NRD1S_B00186L9X2,"Great fun, versaitile and fairly simple HOLD feature allows you to ""record"" individual ""tracks"" and overlap them on one another on the go--live!  Dont get too ambitious though as the more ""tracks"" you add the more distorted the sound becomes.  I haven't used expensive rack units etc., but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses.  Excellent value.  Battery runs out fast so get an AC adaptor!"
A3J1M5WTA3ST77_B002C741BI,"Solid & Cheap Internal Pickup I am not going to say this pickup is the best thing since sliced bread, but it is built solidly and built to last. It is simple, practical, and cheap. There are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that. You don't buy $150.00 pickup for a $200-$300 instrument. Being able to plug in and be self-sufficient (in most rooms, especially at open mics) is easier and better than relying on a mic, especially for beginners, because it takes skill and discipline to stay within the mic's sweet spot. Also, some rooms/PA's/hosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument. At least a pickup like this has the potential for keeping the sound front and center. (I will experiment with different instruments & write more about the quality later.)That said, there is only one piezo element, unlike a K&K; pickup, for example. So it is limited in giving you optimal sound, no matter where it is placed. Also, in case you cannot tell from the image, the soldering connection and wires are exposed on the jack, so it can only be used inside your instrument, which means drilling a hole."

APN77K8OVE97N_B007Q27BH0,"Yorozuya Yokoshima This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima ,not the product. These people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the Us Dream pedal. It was to be shipped from Japan. They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order. This kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on Amazon.com because the item was less than $4.00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item. I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior. I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident."

A1UMOYYM8HB2A1_B004PG1A4A,"Fantastic case Exceptionally well made, this is a fantastic case for the money. (Fifty dollars, including shipping, at the time of my purchase.) It has four(!) very solid clasps, one of which locks. (Two keys are included.) It also features a plush velvet interior, cushioned neck brace, and a strap to keep the top from flopping back, which could stress the hinges and perhaps alter the factory-perfect lid to case alignment. But best of all, it fits my Takamine Jasmine guitar like a glove, holding it secure and (knock on wood) keeping it safe from all harm. I could not be happier."

Also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite 2i2 interface. my cousin and I can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd. So it was something that was necessary. and not waste of money or an unwanted item. Also i don't really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends, so now i can listen through my speakers."

A1TSKKBNV38E8Y_B00J4TBMVO,"These sound great on some guitars, not so great on others... I have reviewed these strings before, and frankly, I wasn't all that impressed with the tone the first time around. I think they feel great on the fingertips and they're very playable, especially for a picker, but I just wasn't sold on the tone. To be fair, I only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars, and found them lacking. There seemed to be a drop-ff in tone when switching from my usual strings (Martin SPs) to these.So this time, I decided to try them on a much smaller guitar. I have a Yairi Alvarez AY-20, which is a 000 sized guitar, and they sound terrific. I'm no engineer or physicist, so I really can't explain the mechanics of it all, but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body, and they produce a very clear, bright tone across the higher range, and hold their own on the low range.I still don't think they're the best thing since sliced bread, and I still think they're a bit overpriced, but I have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than I would expect. This seems to have no effect on the tone, but for what these cost, you'd think the coating would last a lot longer than two months (I play daily for at least 30 minutes a day).Overall, these are good (but overpriced) strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars. You'll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them, and which don't. In my experience, large body guitars lose tone, but they sound great on a smaller body."
A73CB1NVPYDZ5_B000T517Y4,"Great for one type of sound Consider the distortion sound of Cream, the Doors, and ZZ top.  That buzzy, psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does.  Unfortunately, that's about all it does.  However, if you want to have the perfect ""break on through"" guitar intro sound, this is absolutely the pedal for you.  Quality-wise it's awesome, and if I needed that sound I would definitely own one again.  I got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions, and honestly I haven't missed it, because I'm not in a Doors cover band or anything."
A6D91KPQGIDKZ_B0015RIN6U,"Awesome tuner - slight defect This is my third purchase of this tuner. All three work perfectly. Very easy to tune my basses. One is for my younger son who just started playing the bass. The other are for me (one as a backup).The reason why I gave this latest tuner only four stars is because one of the metal connectors that attaches to the 9v battery is too loose and barely hangs on to the battery post. I may have to tape it down to keep it in place. The other two tuners don't have this issue.Still, it's the best around. Buy it!"
A2FAF1J19NO0ID_B0010CAEFS,"Works great. It doesn't twist up like my standard black cable does, but it will twist a bit over time. Love the angle connection for my guitar side as it doesn't just stick right out there. If you really want to avoid on-stage kinks, then you MUST go wireless, it is the ONLY way to avoids twisted cables - no matter what type you buy. This cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion. It's worth spending a Jackson, IMO."
ADH0O8UVJOT10_B000WF1AMU,"Offers enough basic protection at an affordable price My guitars largely stay at home, so they don't require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case.  Hard cases almost always cost 70 dollars or more, and also take up about twice as much room, which is problematic for storing multiple instruments.  In most cases, a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs, and costs about 1/4 of the price of a hard case.I bought two different variations of the Fender Gig Bag, and I believe the one pictured here is the one that has Fender Medium guitar picks as zipper handles, which is a cool touch.  The case fits my Fender/Squier Strat guitars (or other guitars of a similar size) snugly.  There is not a ton of padding, but more than you might think from the pictures, especially on top.  The pocket is fine, and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps.  I can't say that the zippers will withstand years of use, but for most uses, they should do just fine.  Glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars."
A394SBIRC4A8S9_B0002E3CHC,EXP 16 Strings I did not care for the tone or feel. Took them off within an hour and put back on EJ16. They had a rough feel and were stiff. Lots of folks like them but not for me.
A22Z554ZQ8NFPC_B0002F4VBM,"Much better than it has a right to be We live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals.  One could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals.  It's not unusual to see an online review and think a pedal sounds good then find out that it costs $150, $200, $250, $350...whatever.  There are a LOT of really expensive distortion/OD pedals out there.I've had my Bad Monkey for about 7 years, after hearing good things I took a chance and gigged with it for many years.  I rarely use a lot of gain on most pedals, just because those fuzzier tones can easily get lost in the mix.  I generally use the Bad Monkey for mid-gain crunch tones, and for that it's just fantastic.Having two tone controls makes all the difference.  This pedal is Tubescreamer-esque, but not as midrange-heavy as a TS.  Anyway, this thing sounds great.  Excellent classic rock and lead tones.The things it WON'T do: 1) a clean boost.  It has plenty of output, but there's always a little bit of dirt in the signal, so it can't be used as a pure clean boost.  2)  it won't clean up when you turn your guitar down...or at least not much.  No dialing in a crunch tone then turning down your guitar volume for a clean rhythm tone.  I have a Barber LTD which does that beautifully.But, despite those limitations, the Bad Monkey is awesome.  At the very least it can be a great ""throw in your case to take to a jam"" pedal, but it's worth having on your pedalboard, as well."
A22T4H0CPT6UJP_B001FB5Z8K,"The best capo out there This is a great capo!  I had been using Kyser Quik-Change capos for a good portion of my ten years of playing but they had their limits.  For one, intonation wasn't always right and my guitar (especially my electric) would go out of tune frequently.  After trying others, I settled on the Shubb and it outguns the Kyser in every aspect.  Its features surprised me.  It is small and incredibly light weight, you almost can't tell that it's there. The adjustable knob is great and allows you to dial the capo to the right pressure so that you don't get any annoying buzz.  Also my tone has greatly improved (which is an awesome bonus) making my acoustic sound much clearer and much more defined as opposed to the Kyser which I noticed muddied up the sound.  Even though you have to make some adjustments this capo is still easy to use and is one of the best investments I have ever made!"

A781ITP3HE2N5_B004GYOZ6G,"Very well made tuner. I love the way this tuner works, with a bright screen and easy to use controls. The metronome feature is also a nice addition. It's a bit lightweight, making it seem like it wont last very long if even dropped once, but it hit the floor many times on me already and it's still going strong :-) This is a great tuner at an even better price, try it out and see for yourself!"

I tried the mic with other cables I have lying around that I know work, and I got nothing; it was like the mic wasn't plugged in at all.  And the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked.  I still tried it with a difference mic... static.I can't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.The stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package.  I was impressed at how much of is *isn't* plastic.Still... I can't recommend this product."
A3TM9RWCTMIK42_B0041T53KI,"Martin SP strings These are outstanding strings that sound great; just a littler softer (to my ears) than the standard Martin strings. They last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular, non-coated strings."

AMNTZU1YQN1TH_B001FQ74FW,"Great Casters....My Back Appreciates Them (For The Most Part) My Hartke 410VX Cabinet was designed by an idiot....9 million pounds and no casters...not even holes for them. Who invented this thing, He-Man? Anyways, I bought these casters, got out the drill, and punched a few holes in the bottom of my amp, pounded these in, and now it ROLLS. Sadly one of the holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one caster a bit crooked so the amp veers to the right when I push it like a car missing a wheel. But its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing. Of course, we practice at the drummer's house and in his basement so I still have to carry it down and up his stairs, but that's life."
A21Q29J3ZWPDNP_B0002D0C1C,"My top choice for acoustic As a guitarist who's had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center (back in 1999), trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task.  While I'll chose D'Addario EXL's for electric, Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic.  The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money.  They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them...  Granted that's only aesthetic."
A31RULW0KNYJ5H_B0002CZUTM,"Good for When You're Ready for Your Second Guitar I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall, I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again."

A2P3Q65JU68Z5M_B00062GRXQ,"Works fine, but too low for a shock mounted mic This stand works fine if you don't need a shock mount.  The base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations.  I ran into trouble when trying to mount a R0DE NT2-A mic on a shock mount.  The low height (4 1/2"") - which would otherwise help stabilize the mic - left too little clearance between the mic and desktop.  If you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic, you're better off buying the slightly more expensiveOn Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand, Black.BTW, my copy of this stand also did not have the 3/8 inch male thread."
AG1ZYSLKQCLMD_B0002M6CW6,"Gave them another shot I've been playing guitar for 25 years and when I was first getting started for what ever reason I hated Super Slinkys with a passion. I was a Fender or D'Addario guy and EB SS were beneath me.Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I got a used Jackson with DEAD stings on it. I wasn't sure I was going to keep it but wanted to give it a chance with new strings. ALL of my guitars are setup with 10s but the Jackson needed 9's and I didn't want to bother setting up the Floyd Rose for 10's on a guitar I might not keep.I came onto Amazon to find some inexpensive Prime eligible strings and these came up, WTH I'll give them a shot.Wow these are some good sounding strings. I have no idea why I didn't like them before, maybe my hearing is much worse than before? Who knows. Anyway I ended up keeping the guitar, a Jackson DK2M."

A2Z15UQEUTE3T9_B002HPMTZU,"Works well for the most part Well, i just got started playing guitar, and needed a tuner. This thing works well so far, but i didn't have the proper 1/4 inch connector yet to hook my guitar straight into the tuner, which i think would have made it work better. So i used the built-in microphone to tune my guitar. Had no problem with the first through fourth strings, but it had a very hard time picking up the much lower fifth and sixth strings. However, i found that the other strings were very well tuned when all was said and done, and i am happy with my purchase."

I added the boom stand so I can run an SM57 to the surround of my amp's speaker.  I went ahead and ordered two for another amp, just so I don't have to switch them out.  I have a couple of medium sized amps(2 x 10's in each), so I would highly recommend this stand for amplifiers around the same size.  This may not be so great for smaller amps."
A2UGCWC46V7PPG_B0064RFT4A,"An exceptional value... and you can get rid of the pick guard! I'll echo what others have said: this is a superbly built instrument for the price, and I don't know how Epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively. It looks, feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as much.A few notes: what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the &#34;Vintage&#34; model is actually a super-rich deep, deep mahogany/maroon color, and it's unbelievably beautiful.As others have said, the factory-supplied strings are crap; if you judge the instrument by them, you'll be disappointed. Include a set of Aqila Nylgut strings when you order this ukulele, and restring it as soon as you get it.I was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my $60 Kala soprano uke--normally, one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder, fuller sound. But the Les Paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an all-acoustic ukulele, and that probably accounts for the quieter tone. I think it's a *better* tone, and I'm more interested in delicacy than in loudness, so I'm happy with it. If I wanted stadium-filling volume, I could always plug this into a stack of Marshall amps.Oh, I almost forgot one important note to all owners: IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE STUPID, UGLY PICK GUARD! Since ukulele players rarely use picks, and when we do, we use soft rubber or felt ones, there's no need to protect the finish from scratching, and that white pick guard really detracts from the instrument's looks.I applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes, and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernails--no sharp tools! It came off pretty cleanly, leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue. I was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton, without any damage to the luscious ultra-glossy lacquer finish. And the ukulele looks SO much better now! If you feel as I do, feel free to do likewise. Just remember the key words: SLOW and GENTLE. Don't force anything, and you should be fine."
A1XNCV67JBJVF7_B0007SL86A,"Does what it's supposed to. These great little accessories are a nice convenience.  The allow a singer to remove the mic from the stand without the normal loud pop from removing it from a wireless clip.  This particular model adds a feature that locks the microphone in the desired position (older models would swivel without much effort).  Bought 6 to replace to older models I had on stage.  They've worked out great: the mics all stay in position when popped on the straight stands, no spinning.  Copasetic."

A3SU1JZBMQ5ABZ_B003VWKPHC,Works Great and Has the Microphone Feature! I wanted the version of this device with the built-in microphone to be able to check my singing accuracy as well as to tune my guitar. Maybe I should just change the guitar pitch to my off-pitch singing and I could finally achieve perfect harmony! I like everything about it especially (I think) it's ability to turn itself off after use if you forget to do so and save the battery life. A well designed device.
ADH0O8UVJOT10_B00EPWAQS0,"Reissued vintage circuit, somehow stands out as ""unique"" overdrive The EXH Hot Tubes compact pedal offers a very unique sound and is difficult to review from an objective standpoint.  I had no knowledge of or experience with the original full-sized Hot Tubes pedal from the late 1970's.  And, frankly, many of the reviews I read online about both the original and the reissue were less than flattering.  I think part of that hatred comes from the fact that you have an analog pedal without actual tubes that claims (both in the name of the device and in the artwork on the casing) to sound like an overdriven tube amplifier.  Really, though, if you think about it, doesn't EVERY overdrive pedal (including the venerable Tubescreamer) make that same claim?When I plugged into the Hot Tubes, I was surprised, but immediately intrigued.  I actually ended up purchasing this over the excellent East River Drive, which was very good, but also a very &#34;familiar&#34; sounding clone of a TS-808.  What the Hot Tubes does is anything but &#34;familiar&#34; from an affordable OD pedal.This pedal has a significant amount of output, and (unlike many other overdrives) it has considerable low end.  In fact, it likely even adds bass to your sound.  There is a tone circuit bypass switch that I do not fully understand.  Basically, with the switch off, there is no tone control, and they advertise this sound as &#34;powerful&#34; and touch-responsive. Since the pedal trends to the darker side of things, however, I actually left it in the &#34;on&#34; position and worked the tone from the 12:00 to 1:30 settings.The gain structure is as bizarre as it is unique, though it actually starts to make sense if you think about how gain responds on an actual vintage tube amp.  From the 7:00 (0%) setting up to around 12:00, your tone basically remains clean, provided you started with a clean signal.  My setup was a Strat into a Fender Super Champ X2, which is a tube/hybrid amp with a great clean &#34;Blackface&#34; setting.  However, the Hot Tubes completely transforms that tone.  That setting on my amp is normally bright with some great upper end chime, but the Hot Tubes offered a thick, smokey tone that was mostly clean, with maybe a bit of muffled grit mixed into it.As you start get past 12:00 on the overdrive knob, the amount of gain increases exponentially.  At this point, the pedal behaves more like an overdrive, though the gain is almost fuzz-like.  Some people have described it as a &#34;Jack White&#34; type of sound, but I'll really leave it to individual users to decide if they &#34;like&#34; it or not.There are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about.  First, I want to make clear that this is a DARK, bassy pedal.  In that respect, it is completely different from the EXH Soul Food and East River Drive, both of which have some measure of bass drop.  The tone circuit only helps to open up the tone a slight bit, but it could do more.  I do not believe this is the type of overdrive you would stack with - it might actually benefit from a brighter overdrive stacking INTO it.  If your rig is already on the dark or muffled side, you may want to stay away from this pedal.  That being said, I would definitely recommend &#34;try before buy&#34; with this one because it is different in hard-to-describe ways.For now, my rating is 5 stars - solid EHX construction, very compact, accessible 9V jack (on the top where it I like it), and a unique overdrive sound at an affordable price that doesn't sound at all like the other overdrives I have.  It certainly won't be for everybody, but so far, I like what I hear."
A2HBAYOAKSXIY2_B0010CHS8E,"You want the best tone, buy Mogami. What is there to say. If you're looking at this cable, then you must have some knowledge of tone loss. Simple, if you want a studio quality cable that gives you top notch tone signal, buy Mogami. I have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches Mogami. Sure you can buy the expensive Analysis Plus Pro and Evidence Audio cables. But you will NOT hear a difference. Lifetime warranty and you won't be replacing it any time soon. Works flawlessly for live situations and in the studio. All I own are Mogami cables. Check out the silent plug for your guitar cable cord. Goodbye pops and noise."
A110ZEDSNASVCO_B000UJFR4A,I bought the wrong size! Unfortunately I wasn't aware that slides come in all sizes and got a medium when I need the large. The medium fits over my pinky finger and while that's okay I prefered it fit over my index finger where I'd have more control.I cannot fault the slide for my foolish choice so I'll pass this onto my son or someone who can use it and get myself the larger Dunlop 212 Slide.
A2LBHMQ3142G3S_B0010CHS8E,"I love Gold. Yes, you are paying a little extra for peace of mind and the reputation of Mogami gold quality. I found this to be a good investment if you are meticulous about your sound. Compared to my old cable, the Mogami Gold produced a more transparent sound... you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea. When recording guitar, I am able to clearly hear individual strings while playing overdriven chords. No matter your playing style, this cable will work well with your sound."

Anyway, if you are considering buying the amp (which is great), you really will want to have this pedal, even though it costs 33% of the price of the amp itself.With the FBV Express Mk II you can store the 4 amp channels, each of which has its own settings for model and all effects, as well as control the 14 second looping ability of the Spider IV.  The pedal also adds a volume/way pedal (the wah pedal is OK but not as full-throated as a Cry Baby or other stand-alone wah wahs).  Without the pedal, you will not be able to access looping and channel switching in real time while playing (which is the whole point of this thing) unless you have more than the standard compliment of 2 arms, equipped with one  hand each.The pedal also interfaces with a computer to allow deep editing and storing of all of the effects of the Line 6 Spider IV combos through a USB port.  This feature alone makes it a must-have for taking full advantage of the amp.J.M. Tepper"
AGYH5U11ZKPFB_B000E0PPG0,"Cheap It's a cheap speaker stand. Heavier, in terms of weight, than I thought it would be. Cheaply made, the safety pin is kind of a joke. Overall though, it'll do the job. I would not use this at the highest height setting, but one or two notches lower, else it starts leaning."
ASP978VO96X7C_B003HGFRO8,"by mistake i ordered it for Squire M-80 elec guitar its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting Squire fender guitar in terms of E-to-E string spacing, The Low E string out of range and not fit in the hole :("
A3RI2C0RY4DHK_B005VLWHP4,Good Quality Capo - Arrived Earlier than expected. This is a good quality Capo. The built is similar to the ones I see at the local music stores that sells between $9 - $14. I guess they are all made by the same company and then stamped with a logo by whoever is selling it. This capo does not have any logo or stamp but it works just as good as the more expensive ones.I ordered two of this item on 03/18. Expected delivery is between April 11 - 18 as the product will be shipped from Hong Kong but I received the product on April 2nd.I used it in Acoustic Guitar and on the Ukelele without any problem.
A2VH0UT5EQFB6P_B003VWJ2K8,"Works Well and is Beautiful too! There's really nothing I can add to what's already been said about this tuner.  I teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner.  I took a look at it and knew I had to have one too.  This tuner will tune chromatically, so you don't need to buy a special tuner for that.  I can use it on my guitar as well as my guitarlele which is tuned a 4th higher than the guitar.  I chose it over my other chromatic tuner the night my daughter was to play guitar in her school's talent show.  I needed to be able to tune her guitar accurately and quickly despite all the noise in the large room.  It performed fantastically!  (And so did she!!!)It's soft and rubbery feeling and won't scratch your guitar.  The reading are easy to read: red light you're flat, green - you're on pitch and yellow - you've gone sharp. It reads almost instantly.  My other chromatic clip-on tuner had some trouble with the D and low E strings but this tuner seems to give me a pitch quickly.I like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it."
APN77K8OVE97N_B000960KNW,schaller locks This is my second set of these. I bought the 1st set in the 1980's and I'm still using them on the guitar that they matched. (black hardware). I was impressed with the quality of the 1st set and the 2nd set is just as good. Money well spent.
A2ZGEV4CTSCTIZ_B0002GLCRC,If you own several guitars you probably have no floor space. These solve 2 problems at once I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily. Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn't get tripped over or dinged. Enter the String swing.I have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble.The Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster. Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it's own center of gravity.The base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory. I didn't use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs.These are well worth the cost.
A2ZGBCQPF5Q17N_B0002GMGYA,"Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable, Right Angle Plug , 20 feet I bought these for spares and also use on other amps so not to have to swap back and forth.I like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std. Telecaster input jack great.The flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked. These do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage. I have more expensive cables but rather use these."
A2ZGBCQPF5Q17N_B0002F7K7Y,D'Addario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings - .010-.046 Regular... I have been using this brand in several different gauges for many years and continueto do so. I get long life and very good clarity from D'Addarios.
A3B4L653KYTW55_B0002GMGYA,Love it! I wanted something inexpensive and well made and decided to go with Planet Waves over the similarly priced Fender cable. I like it because the tip is one piece instead of screw on and the price was just right. When I have to replace this cable I will likely buy this same cable or something else by PW because of all the cables I have owned PW seems to withstand my abuse most effectively.
AIAH54R6EL4V8_B001V5K2S8,"Excellent! Great bag, well padded the shoulder strap is nice! perfect! and very good price!What you would come to expect from lanikai!"
AZMHABTPXVLG3_B000KIPUQG,"Good Value Does as described and really enhances your tone. Good breadth of tonal variations available. Only negative, and it's not huge, is that it can get a little noisy when the presence is increased beyond half. I was using a bass with two single coils which makes noise more of a challenge to begin with."
A24AQ24CD6865K_B0002H04NE,"Love'em Best articulate bass string for the money.  I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s.  I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued.  They sound great and stay in tune.  Sound like Rotosounds.....think Roger Glover, Geddy Lee, and Chris Squier.  Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick.  I am not a slap style player so I can't comment on that.  I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible. Try them, you'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy."
A1MVH1WLYDHZ49_B002C741B8,"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! It does not stick on to the guitar very well.  Trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but I now have a small circle in the finish of my Martin.  I made mistake of attaching so wife could play Rocksmith and now wish I had used cheaper guitar or better yet, bought a better pickup."
A19J3XY4IO2OYC_B0050ALN2E,Clean or dirty it sounds great! Replaced my beloved Small clone chorus with this pedal and I'm glad I did. This is one lush pedal and it's all analog. This pedal also sounds great with gain.
A20JJ8634DG3FS_B001L8IKLG,"Good tuners, great price on amazon, wish they were locking version These are a direct drop in replacement on Fender Standard (MIM) stratocasters, Fender American Standard, Fender American Deluxe.I have replaced my tuners of this style with Fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the back.Unfortunately, the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish. (But you can get them, ultimately.)I ordered a set of these non-locking ones - the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fender's /schaller's gold hardware. (not all gold hardware is the same color gold). The quality is good and they look and function well. However, I returned them because they are not locking...I ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar I was building.If you just want gold tuners, don't care about the string locking feature, and are playing a fender strat or tele - you can't beat these. By comparison to a lot of the gold tuners, the price of these on amazon is quite reasonable too."
ALHC64J88LVWO_B000B6DHAS,"Awesome little amp After reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp, for the price (about $16-$17) I had to try it.When I plugged my acoustic into this, I was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate.  First, let's not expect $500 double 16&#34; sound from a portable 9v amp.  Once that reality is recognized, it's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.I would note that the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from.  I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different.  One had very rich tone, another sounded &#34;tinny&#34;, another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup.  So it won't sound the same on every guitar.That said, if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome.  I've had it only one day so I haven't put it through the test of time... but first-impressions are that I will buy more of these in the future (I need more than one portable amp).My sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box, and she was impressed as well.  Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp.  And I have to say, the aqua color is major retro.  Gotta luv it.I've been looking for &#34;the&#34; portable amp for some time.  This is the best I've found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance. I don't know as I'd pay the $40-$50 for this guitar shops often ask, but the Amazon price is perfect. : )One last thing:  Danelectro branded 9v battery included, same color as the amp. Priceless."
A2S8G6OVAK19EX_B0002F77B8,"Wow I was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets. The action is better than my six string Epiphone acoustic. It sounds so sweet, looks so sweet, and plays so sweet. I keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck. I would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget. It stays in tune and don't let the laminated top scare you, its great."
A3872Y2XH0YDX1_B0002E1O7W,"Great guitar strings! Love Elixir strings! I bought my first pack, over 7 years ago and I've been hooked. They last, at least, twice as long as traditional copper wound strings, and sound even better. GET THESE! These make my cheap $50 acoustic guitar, sound almost as good as my Martin...no kidding."
AU3GYRAKBUAEU_B000BBRZ3S,"missing one important function This is a nice little tuner. It is small, easy to read and use. It has a non-backlit LCD display of an analog VU style meter, with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents, and red LEDs that light when a tone is sharp or flat. It has a green LED and large mark for being on target. It has a built-in mic for acoustic instruments, and a mono 1/4 inch phone jack for electric instruments. It has an active tone you can switch on for tuning, but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410-480hz. It uses a pair of AAA size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change. If you have any vision problems, the display might be an issue. The LCD is about 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 of an inch high, and, like all non-backlit LCD displays, has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues.I wanted this for tuning didgeridus that I was making, and it works adequately for that. The one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout. As it is, it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat, but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound. So, you know you are tuned to a C, you just don't know exactly which C it is. Probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument, but in some cases would be very handy to know. I suppose with more training and experience, I could learn to tell that by ear. (What? Learn a skill! Isn't that asking a bit much?)I suppose for an inexpensive tuner, that is the trade-off, but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes. Other than that, it seems to work well. It is consistent, easy to use, and compact. I consider it about average in value - it does the basics well but is missing what I consider an important function in such a device. I may be expecting too much for the price, as I have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs. Having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three.In any case, if you don't need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning, this works quite well, and is not very expensive."
A2W7M00WSI4JND_B0002D0E8S,"A Basic Guitar Strap Does What It's Designed To Do I really didn't expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is. It's tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts, It's not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap, but it serves it's purpose well. feels sturdy enough and it's adjustable for a man of any size. I ordered it on the 20th and received it on the 23rd, no complaints here. If you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend 20$ or 30$ on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine, for 6$ you can't beat it. buy one or 2 nothing to lose here"
AOZBVGFIUY44X_B009GT0KNI,"Improved the sound of my Squier Strat! I've just replaced the original, plastic nut on my new Squier Strat guitar with this one.I had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that I wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail file.I was shocked at how much 'brighter' the guitar sounded with only this single change!Even my wife who claims to have a tin ear, commented on how much clearer it now sounds.Also, the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated. My piece arrived in a week (thank you very much!).For the low price, I think this will improve the sound of your guitar (safely) more than any other upgrade."
A2C6Z7M3RMUG45_B000MFN8B6,"Best guitar strings ever These are my favorite guitars strings, they last a long time, bend well, hold great sound, and you won't have to tune your guitar every five minutes like some strings."
A6LFRQ7HMWS1G_B0002H0KG0,I think we did good We bought this for my daughter's boyfriend; we saved it as the last gift to give on Christmas Day; he wrapped the strap around his neck and never put it back down; I still don't think it has come out of his hands for more than a few minutes; I believe he is very happy with his gift!
A2IMZNPSJGB2HQ_B003AYNHGW,Perfect replacement I ordered these because I wanted to deck the tremolo on my Strats because I don't really use the trem. I have a modern American Standard and an American Vintage Reissue Hot Rod 62 Strat. There are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as I can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black. My Standard now has 3 black and 2 silver springs but the 62 Hot Rod has 5 of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with. Easy to install and works like a charm.
A18MMME07XZLYO_B0002D0CGC,"helpful picks i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them, normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dont.if you hate droping your pick while playing,get these."
A2AM4SM8ZA1D9W_B00BHK2UHI,Fare The cable tangles easily. Not stiff enough.It get's in the way and is hard to stay stretched out. But the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types. It also seem tightly put together at the ends.
A3CMSCWXZIVJQ1_B006X735PQ,"I love this thing! This is my new favorite tuner. Not only can you just clip it to the head of your guitar and leave it there permanently, it works like a champ. I don't mean that it works, I mean that it works better than any of my other tuners. It is SUPER tight. It recognizes pitch differences that my ear can't, leaving a better tune than my RP255 or any of the old cheap korg tuners and the like I've got laying around.I plan on buying these for all my guitars."
A3M4FU3WQWJHMP_B000A6GY1I,"Super Buy. These strings fit the Bill perfectly for ""MY"" desired sound from a Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar which has been ""Doctored"" with Bone Saddle, Pins and nut. When I decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ-16 and after all the work was completed......that proved to be true to form. I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar. Elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that I've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar. Try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for..............These are great!!!!"
A2B5LSF5V85SZA_B002Q0WSO8,IMT500 String Tuner I already owned two of these Tuners previously & purchased these for friends. They are great for jamming with friends & are so user friendly & accurate. What is really impressive is that they can stay attached to the headstock of my guitar whileplaying making touch up tuning a breeze. I love mine & so do my friends. In my opinion for the price they are hard to beat.
A3E6FHS8DV037H_B000NJ2TIE,"Great Budget Mics If you're a professional and you're JOB is music, then you may not think these mics are up to your standards in quality.  However, if you're just doing it as a hobby/side job... or even just want the mics for a PA system, then it's really hard to beat what you get in this deal here.  The deal is fantastic.  I use these for recording music at my home as well as recording my online radio show and they've been perfect for me."
A2PD27UKAD3Q00_B0002GXZK4,"This guitar DOES have a BIG SOUND for a small price I was thrilled when my guitar arrived and even more so after I tuned it and began to play.My guitar is absolutely beautiful. The finish is flawless. And it's got that new guitar smell...ahhhhhh.It does have a pick guard (that is not shown in the photo on any website or in any catalog) which pleases me. It would be a shame to scratch the surface while strumming with a heavier pick. I read one review on a music vendor's website where the reviewer complained about Takamine and Jasmine printed all over the pick guard. And they were right about that...but I found it very easy to remove all these words by simply peeling off this protective sticker. Dah.The strings are a little heavier than I like but I'll be changing them in a few weeks anyway.The sound and craftsmanship is anything but what you would expect from such an affordable guitar and everything you'd expect to pay more for. It has a rich, full bodied sound.I am now a diehard Takamine fan."
A2CZIZD0RZ566T_B00A270KYM,"Best for the money! The quality of it is above my expectations. The only thing I would've like different is the accessory box inside. They could've make it a little bigger. The box already fell down 4 times (I got small kids...) and nothing happened to it or the guitar. Great product, worth every penny."
A12O5B8XNKNBOL_B000WN4J9S,"Just a lil extra bling There was nothing wrong with my original neckplate, but I was replacing the rest of the hardwear and pick this up just to add just a little something extra.  IT was a direct replacement for the original."

A6M441DQ7HL09_B000P5OULA,"So nice, he bought it twice Installed one on my CF Martin, almost leaving a thumb super-glued to the inside of the guitar. An interesting experience - would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar. I'm sure that some of my DNA still resides in the guitar.Bought another for my brand new Taylor GS Mini Mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the CF Martin through a brand new Kustom Sienna Pro30 acoustic guitar amp from Amazon. I've read that folks prefer the K&K; over the made-for-the-GS-Mini-Taylor-pickup.Get it."
A1MY8258SXRZ8M_B0002E1O2C,"Awesome strings! I've had these on my Yamaha APX500 for a while now and they sound really good.  A tad brighter than I like, but that's just the nature of the lightness of the strings.  It's real smooth when playing and they seem to be lasting longer than most strings I try.  In fact, I've had these strings on for over 4 months now and they still feel and sound good."
ABC68JUCPTVOE_B00HFRXACG,"D'Addario has a hit on their hands. These may be my new favorite bass strings.Likes:- Bright.  I'd call them &#34;very bright&#34;, except they don't seem to have the harsh twangy tone I'd expect.  They seem bright, yet still soft.- Clear.. The lows sound present and clear.- Consistent flex.  Once I had these on for a couple of days, the tuning seemed very stable.  The tone seems to sharpen less when they are played hard, compared to my last strings.- D'Addario brand.  To me, these guys have a long history of making excellent strings.- Playability.  These feel pretty supple and effortless to work with.- Price. I feel like I should be paying more for these strings.Technology:- New design. &#34;Textured round&#34;.  This is a round-wound string with a hex-shaped core.Overall, love these.  Especially for the price."
A1NAA1R38JSNHV_B0002GXPRM,"Hold mic well in place This is obviously a necessary item if you want to attach this to a microphone stand. It holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce. However, The gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger, as well as the tail-end of the grip; because if you have a certain kind of XLR adapter that is wider than the microphone, you won't be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the XLR adapter first."
A1S0HTDO0P4N5V_B0064RIB9A,"fix the adjustment boom screw and it will be  a great stand The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately.

But after transporting and reset, I found them to be junk."

I use this mainly with a double neck bass/guitar. Compliments well."

Nice build, PVC piping on pocket edges, adequate pad backpack straps for any acoustic weight.  Heavy rubber feet for standing it up, give a 1/2"" of  wet ground protection if needed.For the price of 1 many other brands, I got 2,And for what most folks expect they are great."

A2X2GEABQXRX7P_B0002D0CQC,Essential for any guitar player! This is my fifth time buying this stuff! I really like the new container. The tin is way nicer than the old plastic one. This stuff works great and lasts forever! I play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirty/dry to use. One swipe is plenty (2 strings at a time from nut to bridge); then just fold the cloth and wipe clean. Makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier.
