I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the promotion
of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method, 
procedures,algorythms,
applications, implementation, extensions of NAPLPS/JPEG standards.
These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online
applications that make use of Voice, Video, Telecommuting, HiRes 
graphics,
Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online order entry, Fax,in addition
these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML,CALS,
ODA,MIME,OODBMS,JPEG,MPEG,FRACTALS,SQL,CDrom,cdromXA,Kodak PhotoCD,TCL,
V.FAST,EIA/TIA562,can best be incorporated and implemented to
develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications....
 
We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2 
platforms.
It is our hope that individuals,developers, corporations, Universities,
R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.
 
This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).


Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.


Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(
new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.
Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.


Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).
 

Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my 
opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection.


There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, 
vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune 
response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A 
status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.
But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(
like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.
Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's 
what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however.

I want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most
basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement
relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that
assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not

Falsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows
corrupting both the intellect and the heart.

(type II, I guess--no insulin). 


I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. 
Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain. 

For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about
eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. 
Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much
interest, like bread on the waters.


With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.

Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a
balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.

Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk (""It's strep;
give him this and he'll get well."") and so my expectations are too high?

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try 
replacing the battery.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor

54702,"Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:

1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim 
translation"" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --
the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section
by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.
In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce 
the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not 
surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a 
single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi
law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, 
urban-folklore style.

2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a 
copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution 
team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't 
understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable 
to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and 
yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:

""If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons
Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of
documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German
law registry].""

Bingo.  Exactly.  

Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one
under discussion.  All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman
have a copy of a Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  He
then continues:  ""But if he acquired the original German text of the 
Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so 
for a very specific reason...""  But there's absolutely no reason to 
think that this is the case.  In fact, as a ""senior member of the U.S. 
team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that
he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether 
the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously
is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally
prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red 
herrings.

3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the
JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he 
asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge 
levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask 
to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd 
took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing 
it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, 
wouldn't he?
    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier
posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this
purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent
on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil
liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it
on their own?
    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his
own question: ""Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law
to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the 
Nazi law.""  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered
into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents ""concerning
the history of Nazism and gun confiscation"", Dodd's motivation isn't a 
mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.

4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that
was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  
Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT
a ""Nazi-inspired"" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 
1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification 
of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list 
other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;
of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,
in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the 
discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, 
""Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..."" -- so 
as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law."

Well said, Michael!

The Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual 
Works of Mercy:

admonish the sinner
instruct the ignorant
counsel the doubtful
comfort the sorrowful
bear wrongs patiently
forgive all injury
pray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy 
                           on this and I don't want to argue about it.)

These are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  People 
ask questions and express doubts.  Some are in need of comfort or 
prayers.  Imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs 
patiently and forgave injuries.   I would add that it is probably more 
appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly."

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in 
exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an 
endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure 
of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but 
fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have 
comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former, 
in the long term, unless you have the latter.

One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird 
cross between a libertarian and an ""establishment tool"" is that I end up 
taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when 
the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my 
lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  

As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government 
to be ""fair"".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, 
whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the 
government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.  
What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal, 
so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) 
sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth 
it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its 
citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the 
major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a 
couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it 
would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I 
agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly 
participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a 
strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.  
I've already written off politics.

And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive 
faster than 55 MPH, too.

The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its
directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later
called a ""gimmick"" -- a conclusion I disagree with).  Since the
detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's
significantly more expensive.  While the added capabilities may not
help you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where
there are a lot of false-alarms.


I certainly call it ""interesting"" but I'm another person who thinks
that the added value might be coming at too high a cost.  Very
adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and
one of them has suited me rather well.  If I did more long-distance
travelling in areas I'm not familiar with I'd probably consider
getting the V-1 because it's additional information would be useful in

No, you have completely misunderstood.  I was opposed to intervention in
Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is
no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the
lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us
to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much
greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far
better reasons to take action than the US.


You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to
intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this
word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as
racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I
said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result
of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and
3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side
would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the
conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite
the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was
considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news
I see are any guide.

Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally
(the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the
goalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment getting

   That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something
   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be
   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the
   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the
   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output
   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.

   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that
   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that
   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,
   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output
   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think
   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.

Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and
not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system
makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now
only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits
wouldn't turn up anything interesting.

   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased
   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.

The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but
I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy
which was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search
take far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim that
the real keysize can be verified externally."

Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,
based on information provided by NASA headquarters.

The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the
Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The
day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics
covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for
the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the
assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management
options and operations concepts also were held.

The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:

¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest
said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has
identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended
and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed
to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable
capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified
Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing
systems such as the so-called ""Bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and Spacelab.

The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom
photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab
missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.

Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.
Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking
ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter
docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different
operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.

¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option
B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,
from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent
Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent
Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the
baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking
system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data
Management System.

Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree
inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration
orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic
arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.

Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss
segments and the U.S. lab.

Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two
orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.

Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other
section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and
propulsion systems.

The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete
state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,
a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete
the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.

Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware
would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived
option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including
program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and
operations costs, he said.

¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,
the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid
rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle
main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
and jettisoned after ET separation.

The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000
cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a
centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various
places on the circumference of the module to place the international
modules, and other elements.  This ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic
arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial
attitude.

In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor
said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so
that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the
Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.

Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space
experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members
of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space
Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. 
Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,
the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team
briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking
systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the
Soyuz TM spacecraft.

The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities
of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian
capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will
be available to the SRT through May 5.

Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT
subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to
develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a
foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various
management options have been developed including:

¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of
command.

¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate
Administrator.

¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located
hand-picked program office.

¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an
element of the current program.

¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and
geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.

The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the
Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had
already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its
preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.

As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency
experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of
assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing
and ground operations.

What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a
comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday
and Tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the
detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing
for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to
be held May 3.

Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the
Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the
activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant
deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve
as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to
consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request
from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.

Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being
carried on the schedule are:

April 26
Design Freeze on Options for Costing

April 27
Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT

May 3
Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee

May 15
Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee

June 7

I think Orthodox practice varies from place to place, from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under
 7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting. As we have to travel 70km to the church, we don'

The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts

enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides
avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.

When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions,

I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap
focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.

(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus
explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on
MB1)."

Not according to the NEC nor the CEC, as explained in the electrical wiring

Of course, as they said -- ""Local codes may vary"". 


I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are
connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the
main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground
rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of
the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot
to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  

Hmmm.  How are those orange ""isolated ground"" outlets (often used in

Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is
a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.

Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom
of the 13th.  Who won the game?

-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.
-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent
 defensive plays behind him to do so.
-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and
 got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of
 the inning.

Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for
the win.

How about the offense?
-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either
 one, the Sox would have lost in nine.
-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.
-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first
 to third when...
-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.
-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of
 a help, but it was something.
-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the
 way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)

Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were
credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit
that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as
much as Richardson?

Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than
runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the
game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with
only one out!

Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You
can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the
clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't
*claim* to try to tell you that.

Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.

Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies
about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by
the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding
of their relationship with the Lord. Today the if the general populace 
hears ""prophesies"" like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn
ones, they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship
(or lack of it) with the Lord. They are far more likely to think that
they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter.
That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement
prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This
doesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look
at Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section is
below. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both
prophesies posted here.

--- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech----

Both read the same Bible, and pray 
to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem 
strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing 
their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not
that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither
has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto the
world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh"" If we shall suppose that American 
Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come
but which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to remove
and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to
those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from
those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe 
to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty 
scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, 
until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of 
unrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with 
the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three 
thousand  years ago, so still it must be said ""the judgments of the Lord, 
are true and righteous altogether""
  With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right, 
as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we 
are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which 
may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, 
and with all nations.

               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-
          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL 
          DATUM""). 
      
               At each step in the development, Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles 
          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star 
          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white 
          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY 
          BURSTS). 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of 
          matter. 

               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy 
          complex mathematics, in his books.

          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  
          They have other related publications, including the quarterly 
          journal ""RECIPROCITY"". 

          

          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer 
          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he 
          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used. 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same 
          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally 
          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in 
          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. 
    
               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been 
          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! 
    
               ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"", 
          ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. 
    
    
               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, 
          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or 
          still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring. 
    


          ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super 
          Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific"" 
          value. 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY 
          particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.) 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, 
          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are 
          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment. 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! 
    
               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 
          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money?! 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground 
          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the ""Supercollider""?! 
    
          
               Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as 
          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. 
      


          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made, in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, 
          which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"". 
     
               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, 
          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their 
          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each 
          other. 
      
               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half. 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, 
          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to 
          help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"". 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by 
          INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his 
          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special 
          Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near 
          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 
          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low 
          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. 
          [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing 
          about this.] 
    
     
               In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  
          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY). 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific 
          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 
          pages, indexed, hardcover. 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and 
          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-
          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white 
          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS! 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success: 
          In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also. 
    

 
          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS

               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were 
          originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the 
          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence). 
    
               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of 
          his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the 
          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls 
          the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the 
          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and 
          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at 
          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects, and come from all 
          directions uniformly.) 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to 
          stop it! 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B. Larson. 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is 
          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" 
          and in some of his other books. 
    
               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate 
          energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the 
          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements. 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some 
          of his books [better than I can]. 
    
               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. 
    
               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R 
          Diagram. 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space, making a single lone star 
          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system, orbiting each other. 
     
               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown 
          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron 
          stars"", ""black holes"", etc.. 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single 
          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf 
          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably 
          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! 
      
               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all 
          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law. 
          


          ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!

               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black 
          holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and 
          concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original ""black holes"". 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black 
          holes"", etc.! 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is 
          clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black 
          hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to ""prove"" their theory. 
    
    
               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is 
          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and 
          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT! 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of 
          Unified Science). 
          
          
          
          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe.  I quote one paragraph: 
    
               ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  
          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It 
          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in 
          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the 
          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open 
          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, 
          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system.  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  
          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."" 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).  
          (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, 
          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and 
          ""below"" labels mixed up.] 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-
          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light! 
    
               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge 
          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle.) 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds. 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has 
          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in 
          his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"". 
    
               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as 
          the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such 
          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, 
          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and 
          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. 
    
          

               For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,

[Question and part of the answer deleted]

  If you are handy with a soldering iron, the loopback plugs are easy to
make.  On a serial RS-232 nine-pin port, use a female DB-9 connector and
connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232 
25-pin ports, you'll need a female DB-25 connector with pins 1 to 7;
2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25
connected.  To test a Centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to
connect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male
DB-25 connector.

Um, I hate to break this to you, but article numbers are unique per site.
They have no meaning on other machines.


You mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests

Like youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?


No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid
which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that
excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain
conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few.
This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid
in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.


I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.


Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any
controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far
as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is
not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently
ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe
that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.


Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink?
Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much
glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that
added by the use of MSG?


Notice the subtle covering of her ass here: ""anyone _with a sensitivity_...""
We're disputing the size of that class.


Impeccable.  There most certainly is a dispute.

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst.
However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?

Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)
Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs.
Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.

Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).
Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs.
Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a 
different SS.

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar
has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.

Do it in private, and it won't be a problem.  But the reason that
the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is
that they want:

1. To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work, and
not have people get disgusted;

2. To be able to wear their NAMBLA T-shirt and not worry about
getting fired;

3. To be able to have access to young boys, so that they start
making the next generation of homosexuals.

If your right to privacy is what makes sodomy laws unconstitutional
(a position that I agree with), then keep it private, and there
won't be a problem."

On one hand you state that ""things have changed dramatically"" but, at the
same time nothing you ""can think of has changed"".  Your girlfriend seems

I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor.  It's
a very good environment to examine issues.  

The fact of the matter is:  your girlfriend has a different perception than
you.  The TWO of you need to address the issue in order to resolve it.

Very interesting are the graphics results (Graphics 30.052) couldn't belief this, but it is true. Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o




wn clockspeed so they wont make truble.

The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.

See, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant
if it is ""voluntary.""  Why do you think this?

And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.


You are attaching too many things to the term ""moral,"" I think.
Let's try this:  is it ""good"" that animals of the same species
don't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right? 

Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do
is either right nor wrong?



Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sort
of mating ritual or whatnot.


Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  What
do you mean by ""consider?""  Can a small child be moral?  How about
a gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Does

One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training
are ineligible to apply for resident alien status.  In order
to get the green card they have to return to their country and
apply at the embassy there.  Of course, many somehow get around
this problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town
with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks
a rider onto a bill saying ""Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent
residency in the US.""  A lot of bills in congress have such riders
attached to them.  Marrying a US citizen is the most common, although
now they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell US
citizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines, or
whereever.

Question:
If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-
by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them.


Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how

standard deviation in the league be used?

20837,"A ""new Christian"" wrote that he was new to the faith and 
learning about it ""by reading the Bible, of course"". I am not
at all sure this is the best path to follow.
	While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the 
revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this
revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one
denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian
congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just
reading the Bible.
	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although
I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the
Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are
comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to
read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable
lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really
sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.
	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith
of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital
beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -
the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church
organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the
lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one
hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies
in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.
	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I 
would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the
christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing
the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into
the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading
Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard
Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor
Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,
but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,
I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after
reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being
a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in
some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by
the person of Jesus Christ."

It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing
budgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that
COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who
use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they
have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked
pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually
likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  That's okay, marketing
isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's
superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot
more to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they
could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even
use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with
compatability issues and absconding with the technology.

DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch
marketing and vendor agreements.  The ""mediocre"" was excusable in the
early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years
to play with it.

An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in
the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and
programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least
have the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0
and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?"

interface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh,

This is true.

easier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing
down our throats for some time now...)

The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users
running windows (all flavors) and the other ""power"" users running Unix
and other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty
much king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo

  But the ""values and systems that make the rich rich"" all basically
  amount to freedom of choice. 

  In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family
  farm.   Farm economy households were economically diversified, producing
  not only agricultural goods but also ""manufactured"" goods, especially 
  cloth.  Many farm women carded, spun, and/or wove, producing not only
  cloth for their own family but also to sell, generating extra income.

  But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England
  and by the 1820's it had moved to the US, in both cases in the form 
  of textile mills.  These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently
  and cheaply than people at home.  

  The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out
  and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to 
  go to work in these same mills in Lowell, Mass, or Nashua, NH, where
  they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening, dangerous conditions, living 
  regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis-
  eases due to the work.

  Now people didn't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth. 
  They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support
  their local economy . . . 


  . . . but (sorry for the cliche), ""it takes two to tango"".   The big
  rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff.
  It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also 
  its social center.  You KNEW the merchants you did business with 
  or even local kids working behind the counter.   You would see
  people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat.

  Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop 
  at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of
  thousands or millions.  You have no particular relationship with the
  companies you do business with, and feel no particular commitment
  to them, nor they to you.   Major components of what defines a ""com-
  munity"" have been destroyed.   On the other hand the products we buy
  at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign
  manufacture, and they are probably of better, or at least more consistent,
  quality.



  Don't blame the conservatives for this.  Everyone makes their own
  individual choice and the liberals and the fence-sitters are just
  as guilty of pretending there are no social and cultural consequences
  to economic choices.

[...stuff deleted...]

Andy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were 
each using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I
think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them,
though your usage is quite valid.


I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way
reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or 
describes things we can observe.

Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't
just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution
is still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started
because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,
basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a 
clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of
evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.

I'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger
about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_
proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves
are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not 
the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered 
fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle 
systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original 
point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only 
the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_
atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough
to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being 
any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.

The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:

   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)
      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational
        evidence (your way)

   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it
        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence 
	and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can
        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't
	much to say.

Do you agree?

MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced

What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need
to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for
another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light
bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against
the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light
will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't

""A note on gamma correction and images""

Author: Graeme W. Gill
        graeme@labtam.oz.au

Date: 93/5/16


""What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?""
--------------------------------------

Although it would be nice to think that ""an image is an image"",
there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded
images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image
viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some
look too light. ""Why is this ?"" you may ask. This, is gamma correction
(or the lack of it).

Why do we need gamma correction at all ?
--------------------------------------

Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode
ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene, then you have created a ""linear"" or un-gamma-corrected
image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).
Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this:

Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma

So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image
will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to ""gamma correct""
the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT
will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get
what you want. So you have to do this to your image:

gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)

For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.

If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?
-----------------------------------------------------

The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.
Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras
or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are 
rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those
images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will
look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular CRT.

Whose fault is all this ?
-----------------------

It is really three things. One is all those display programs
out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is
that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or
don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.
The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying
gamma's.

At least two file formats do the right thing.
The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording
the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a
linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).

Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and
utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.

[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the
appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity
in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends
to give a tint to the image. ]

How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg
(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using
dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a
bit.)

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center.

If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be
around 2.2 

[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the
-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA
environment variable in your .profile]

How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?
-------------------------------------------------

This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of
1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma
correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images
(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected
to some degree or other.

If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will
look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.

Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as
Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium. This is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic. This means images 
could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),
if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level.

If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image)."

As a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap Reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant Laffer curve (NOT!) I
think we need to look with open minds upon any ideas which will allow us

Note the difference here. One is saying, if *Christ* disagrees with 
a Christian being gay, *Christ* can change that.

The other is saying, if *I* think being gay is wrong, that a Christian
cannot be gay, *I* need to tell them to change.

Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I 
would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The
older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would
assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some
if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.

Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study.
My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and
more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The
independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy
the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second
difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm
not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive
system. The older Landcruisers have a ""lock-up"" type. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages."

61208,"Two developments have brought these type of activities back to
the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a
20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from
the Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank,
NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner
reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-
based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV
commercial, as filmed from the Mir.
   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the
same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga
booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""Environmental
Billboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the
University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""Environmental
Billboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,
deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.
   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for
maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone reading
sensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's
delicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head of
SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns,
it will release ozone-building components that will literally
replenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitor
the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns
up and ""adds to the ozone supply.""
   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several
millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI
estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who
watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost
$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being
promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
  
But back to Brian's questions:
  
    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my
estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus
$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to
tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for
optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon
someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated
launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.
    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as
well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use
of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the
legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,
and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light
pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal
challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive
aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the
advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change
positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the
space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an
idiot?)
   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low
enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would
only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before
dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just
after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time
of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still
be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)
    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There
were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga
advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for
only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding
for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking
for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I
am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.
  
   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be
my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least
I don't THINK I do...).

Paul-- for the same reason that many other colonies are founded. Why not?
"
52090,"Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I
had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU
but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.

Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted
before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.
I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher
speeds.

Parts

	Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of
	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the
	oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend
	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.

	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for
	   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:

		   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)
		   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)
		   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)

	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.

	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a
	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)
	   
	Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as
	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins
	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.

	Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a 
	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had
	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which
	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up 
	   something similar or risk frying your CPU.
	   
Procedure

1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.

2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from
	the back of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic
    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,
	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.
	
9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to
    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.
	
10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of
    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic
	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The
	motherboard then comes directly out.
	
11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the
    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators
	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.
	
	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of
	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure
	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.
	
	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is
	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is
	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without
	proper care.
	
12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.

13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the
	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the
	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new
	50 mhz clock.
	
14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.
	
14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.

15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother
    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.
	
16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

18) Replace the phillips head screw

19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.

21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn 
    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,
	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your
	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.
	
	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and
	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and
	be astounded. 
	
	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding
	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up
	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since
	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single
	problem.
	
Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real
risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than
$50 in parts."

  More RAM, Faster CPU's, More disk space, Faster Ethernet...  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation.

  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity.

  This ""FAQ"" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.

  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must
  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
  However, they are outside the scope of this document.

    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    ""System Performance Tuning"" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the
    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written
    comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any
    other similar books.  --ed.]

Introduction & Administrivia
-----------------------------

  This document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the
  Usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers.
  If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few
  months old (see the ""Last-modified"" date above) you should probably
  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does
  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can
  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.

  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about
  them and how to access them, please see the ""Introduction to the
  news.answers newsgroup"" posting in news.answers.

  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document
  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If
  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by

What about the ""Other X FAQ""?
-----------------------------

  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
  well written ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" document.
  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance.

  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with
  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:
	""Use X11R5, it is faster than R4"".
  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).

---------------
Window Managers
---------------

  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this
  point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager. 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
  is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"".
  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)
  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.

The X Server
------------

Which Server?
- - - - - - -
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.

  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging.

                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law
  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be
  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
  You can expect to get ""*very* large speedups in the server"" by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
  compilers on the market.

Locking the Server into RAM?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help
  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.

Starting your Server
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my
    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.

  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  

  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works, which I have summarized here:

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of
    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you
    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up.

    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
    being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so
    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this
    initialization is done (""The process has reached a steady state""),
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" situation, as there
  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap
  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
  you are starting, etc.

  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

  I've experimented with:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &

  I've even tried:
	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &
  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
    into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched. ]

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with
  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

Fonts
- - -
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server.
			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),
			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]

  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13
  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since
  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.

  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):
    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.

About the Resources File
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  One suggestion:

    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true

    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your
    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

    [ The ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
    --ed.]

    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,
    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system
    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to
    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name.

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),
		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),
		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits:

    - Easier to maintain / more usable.

    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

  It also has drawbacks:

    - the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference, and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
      application without having to ""xrdb"" again.

    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!

      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
      processing the resource file.

      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef
      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management.

    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For
      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.

    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
  .Xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for
  clients that I seldom use.

Define Your Display Properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In
  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  ""<hostname>:0.0"", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to ""unix:0.0"" or "":0.0"".  By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]

  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name.

  ""I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.""
			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)

  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if
  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]

-------
Clients
-------

  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also
  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock?

  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]

  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In
  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually
  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.

  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try
  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif
  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library.

  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment.

A Better Clock for X
- - - - - - - - - - -

1) xcuckoo
   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.
   Saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar

   Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources.

  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and 
  takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  From the README file distributed with xterm:

  +-----
  |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here
  |
  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
  | ...
  +-----

  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.

  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]

1) Xvt
   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :
   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z

   ""...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog! ""

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to
   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.

   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For
   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap
   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard
   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.

   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
   brought into memory.

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,
   relative speed of each

2) mterm
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

   ""I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is
   scrollback, but some people like it anyway.""


Tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets:

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not
    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference
    on a [slower system].

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests?

-------------------------
Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

Pretty Pictures
- - - - - - - -
  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.

  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)

  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) 
			for reminding me of this one. --ed.]

A Quicker Mouse
- - - - - - - -
  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse.  I use ""xset m 3 10"" in my .xinitrc file,
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.

  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for
  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  

  e.g. (for twm) :
      menu ""mouse settings"" {
        ""Mouse Settings:""			f.title
	""  Very Fast""				! ""xset m 7 10 &""
	""  Normal (Fast)""			! ""xset m 3 10 &""
	""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)""	! ""xset m default &""
	""  Glacial""				! ""xset m 0 10 &""
      }

Programming Thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
    things you can do.  Some that stick out:

    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.

    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.

    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.
      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)

    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference.

    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one.

  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :
    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]

  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :

  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.

    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but
    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the
    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most
    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's event-loop again and again.

  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.

    This ""Gfx Context Switching"" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Say What!?
- - - - - - 
  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:

  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :
    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server.

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received
  the following confirmation...

  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was
    essential when I only had 8 MB.

  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :
    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a
    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's
    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they
    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your
    action.

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
    even fewer context switches.

----------------------------
Other Sources of Information
----------------------------

  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System
  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):
    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper ""Improving X
    Application Performance"" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in
    Issue 3 of The X Resource.

    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992
    conference proceedings.

    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.

The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in
the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and
not an entirely different source.
 
 
 
We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual
explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider
their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke
that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).
 
As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence
for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.
 
 
 
When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on
putting John after the rest of the three?
 
 
 
Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be
fine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?
 
 
 
That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.
 
The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?
 
One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.
Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.
 
 
In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like

     Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years. 

     My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In 
particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in 
altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude 
of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 
March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the 
limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.) 

    This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 
degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But 
it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation.

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without
doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been
known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting
smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the
person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the
interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per
day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still
rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned
about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and
even a small increase in risk is significant there.

On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged

# Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to

# not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith
# on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is
# truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

It may be ""irrelevant"" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say
""bias""?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You're right, ""the
bottom line IS truth,"" independant from you or anyone else.  Since you
proclaim ""truths"" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what
authority you do this?  Because ""it says so in the Bible?""  --Does the
Bible ""say so,"" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a
scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or ""disapproval""?

Excuse moi, but your line of ""truths"" haven't moved me one bit to persuade
me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the ""preachers"" of ""truth"" on
this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking
crew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...
BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus
to the pharisees: ""ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,
but your hearts are far removed from me...""

# Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
# and eternally existent are equivalent, you say ""granted the Mormon
# belief..."" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
# have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address
# and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
# conclusion that you grant.

Sophistry.  Look who's talking: ""jumping to conclusions?""  You wouldn't do
that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless
whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points
of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
whatsoever.

Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible
indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they
""belong to"" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have
rebelled against God, and are not ""children (=followers/redeemed) of God,""
but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to
separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of
salvation.

of satan's spirit-origin (and of those who followed him) has not been
addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more ""constructs of imagination""
than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about ""the only true God,"" whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different
way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.

#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but

Sigh.  ""What the Bible teaches""?  Or: ""what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co.?""  I respect the former, I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by
the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you
being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a
Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).

#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-
represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of ""official doctrine""
is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial
(e.g. ""The Seven Deadly Heresies"" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
or erroneous at worst (""blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation"").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations (his book ""Mormon Doctrine"" is oftentimes referred to
as ""McConkie's Bible"" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather
look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!
(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most
biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...

60824,"Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It
would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.
The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to
ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main
spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer
momentum to the ship.

  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion
heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave
into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are
going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,
helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic
radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission
products).

  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems
to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
they're there.

  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

  Thanks.

  I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and 
  made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most
  evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of
  experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA
  resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.
  
  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It
  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the 
  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed
  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.
  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer
  one.

No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  I'm
rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature
in the accepted academic/scientific journals.  So, the righteous among
them will no doubt jump on that.

Also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption
that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the
GI tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for
maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too.

Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even
though he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his
nineties--but nevermind about that.  He shouldn't charge for his
equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the
FDA.  Of course, with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can
charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as
thalidomide.  But nevermind about that either.

To me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used
to decrypt any previously recorded conversations. I gather that from this
proposal a warrant would be required to get the keys, but not to collect
conversations! Consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively
all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and
not necessarily ""legitimate"" targets), then arranges for some unrelated
incident that can trigger a warrant:

   ""Your honor, we know that the suspect has received calls from noted 
crime figure Bugsy Butthead [said calls arranged by the agency] and we must 
therefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect, in a
sensitive govt post, is corrupt.""

  I suppose that it is conceivable that there are session keys involved
somewhere, but that doesn't seem likely; if there are, why wouldn't the
technical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the number
of bits held by each escrow authority?

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette

This is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.
We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.
Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu 
as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography 
FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers 
every 21 days.


Contents:

* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?
* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?
* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?


* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?

  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always
  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.
  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same
  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the
  readers want to see.

* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?

  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were
  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be
  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many
  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,
  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of
  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your
  postings in the right group.

  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic
  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.

* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?

  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some
  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a
  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.

  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some
  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by
  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the
  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is
  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some
  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts
  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but
  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most
  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.

  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,
  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and
  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the
  introductory textbooks.

  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at
  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens
  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily
  answered on your own.

  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some
  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your
  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to
  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated
  in some areas.)

  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.
  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted
  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break
  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough
  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will
  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to
  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more
  layer of complication and come back for another round.

  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA
  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope
  of this FAQ."

60999,"Does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it's possible)
adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc.

I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2
Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  They work great, I haven't had
any problems!

Well, now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
(larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk.

That didn't happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots
back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target
0/target1/target2].  All three disks are seen.

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to
select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it's not there.
The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
no-where to be found....



ARGH!

Ideas anyone?????

Thanks in advance!

           It's my understanding that the U.S. Supreme Court has never 
       given a legal definition of religion.  This despite the many 
       cases involving religion that have come before the Court. 
           Can anyone verify or falsify this?  
           Has any state or other government tried to give a legal 
       definition of religion?

 First of all I think when ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job, but
 last night I felt the same way. I really hate watching Devils/Pens game. 
 Everyone knows that Devils are going to get their ass kicked, why even 
 bother showing them. I was so bored and these ESPN people don't seem to have
 any brain. After the Sundays and last night games, they are still going to 
 show Devils/Pens on THU and SUN. WHat the hell are they thinking about? I 
 think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract.
 I'd rather see Caps/Isls game which is more exciting. 

 Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast
 we can get diffrent hockey games.

21642,"Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know  
Christian homosexuals before judging them.  I maintain that I was not  
judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong.   I would like to  
look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical  
evaluation of the people who responded to the side of Christianity  
and homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals  
but I know that many are from their e-mail responces).  I don't  
normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but  
since I have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point I will.

So far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because I don't  
have the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling.  If  
you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you  
who are homosexual Christians show me the diffrence."

Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath.
He was never ever a musician in the band.  He was in St. Louis several
months back.  The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent
really turned me off.  It was addressed to all ""Homosexuals, prostitutes,
drug addicts, alcoholics, and headbangers..."" or something like that.

Well, if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I
would have felt a little pre-judged.  As a Orthodox Christian, and
a ""headbanger"" I was slightly insulted at being lumped together with
drug addicts and alcoholics.  Oh yes, I suppose since I drink a good
German beer now and then that makes me an alcoholic.  NOT!

83811,"There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among
Southern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and
I suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily
agree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.

 *

For a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book
claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.
(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the
Masons.)

The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,
which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few
years ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded
that it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.
However, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and
last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the
feeling that they were saying ""You got the wrong answer last time, try to
do better and get the answer we want."")

Anyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but
the dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,
but everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things
such as: ""This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.""

The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the
hospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the
elderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-
known Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings
of Masonry are ""supportive of Christian faith and practice"".  Examples of
the latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and
that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.

On the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible
with Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some
people consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they
are not meant seriously), the ""undeniably pagan and/or occultic"" writings of
some Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation
can be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many
Masonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole
aren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)


The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership
should not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.
This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,
and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may
not.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of
the believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably
influenced how the report came out.

 *

The information above was gleaned from ""The Religious Herald"", a publication
of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and ""Baptists Today"", which
does not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a
big issue among some Baptists.  8-)

Because I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are
relevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your
mileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.

20956,"Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this,
but the Branch Davidian compound is no more.  This morning about 6:00,
the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They 
then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult
members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30
people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or
70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were
inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.

Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off
and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come
out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his
message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out.
He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that
God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in
Revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the
first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then.
The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they 
would be subjected to tear gas.

I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere
man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I
think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in
things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures

For pitchers:

discusses the forms of ""kleros"" (eg: kleros, kleroo, etc), and the various
meanings of ""kleros"" (eg: ""plot of land,"" and ""inheritance""), but mentions
nothing about CHORION or ""burial plot."" (Why does this not surprise me?) Thus
it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference.]

I owe the group an apology.  It is my habit to check my articles before and
after their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:
 
 
I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus
confused ""kleros"", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of
land discussed.  In actuality it is ""chorion"", which is the last word Acts
1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss ""chorion"" so I
cannot report as to the nuances of the word.

someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating

Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you

see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other

to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present
shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).
At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a
total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating
around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe
it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:
Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use
several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.
It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.

PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one

(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;
(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look
at your defense of this later.
 
Also, the ""reward of iniquity"" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of
silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at
stating why you believe it is).
 
At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural
groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.

that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these
passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's

_____________________________________________________________________
 
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING
HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND ""FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN""
=============================================================
 
This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at
all.
Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do
they necessarily contradict each other?
Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that
Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be
true and supplementary.
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are
not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time.
On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the
case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event.
 
_____________________________________________________________________
 
Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit
inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.
Here's what you said in an earlier post...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
DB [quoting Tony Rose]...
 
""The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so
opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to
find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David
Joslin's.""
 
_____________________________________________________________________
 
Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too ""heavy"" for
the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say
it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it
didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.
 
Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or
are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an
alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe
in this respect.
 
DB...
""At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:
 
 
Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.""
 
MY REPLY...
I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a
call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.
 
To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
""begging the question"", if I may quote you.
 
[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian
Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these
terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM
show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]
 
DB...
""This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other
qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.""
 
MY REPLY...
Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention
below.
Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we
have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But
he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
discover.
 
DB...
""Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects
Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.""
 
MY REPLY...
Thank you, Dave.
 
DB...
""Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the
hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^
 
MY REPLY...
[^^^ above, mine]
So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's
position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?
 
Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done
with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
their ""interpretation"" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
 
You also noted they ""interpreted"" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although
that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,
that's the first criteria we must examine.

""In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation

MY REPLY...

No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly
probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.
 
The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New
Testament.
 
In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
was buried in his father's tomb.""             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept.,
APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the
result.
In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.
 
Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply
means ""hang oneself"".

_____________________________________________________________________
Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.
 
MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
price of blood."" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of
Blood to this day.
 
First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of
hanging. All it says is that he ""went and hanged himself."" Luke however, in
Acts, tells us that ""and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out."" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the
other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that

Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.
Let's look at the passage in Matthew:
 
MAT 27:4 saying, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" And they said,
""What is that to us? You see to it!""
 
MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself.
 
MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""It is not
lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.""
 
MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.
 
MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
 
Notice verse 5...""Then he...went and hanged himself.""
Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a
result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What does Acts say?
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
 
ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of
reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the ""two"" accounts of Judas'
death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
say Judas ""hanged himself"", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the
hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no
contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.
 
.......
 
MY REPLY...
...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be
the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________________________________________________________________
 
I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,
highly probable.                            ^^^^^^
 
DB...
""By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as
the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  ""The Biblical Knowledge Commentary""
suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).""
 
MY REPLY...
The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a
superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted
post gave us some...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open.

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the
source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the
prophesy of the Potter's field came from).""
 
MY REPLY...
Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
this with you.
 
DB...
As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically
mention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerning
Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").  Now I would point out
that when the Bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediately
discusses ""*the* reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.""
 
MY REPLY...
Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
 
ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
ACT 1:16 ""Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus;
ACT 1:17 ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.""
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field
is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used.  Rather, it states
that Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"".
But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
         ^^^^^^
JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had
said to him, ""Buy those things we need for the feast,"" or that he should give
something to the poor.
 
So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of ""wages of
iniquity"" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the ""wages of iniquity"" are.  What do you think, Dave?

Kenneth Wuest's expanded translation of the New Testament does the same - it puts the range of verse numbers next to the top of each paragraph. Being an expanded translation it is quite verbose though - more suitable for detailed study than for quick reading.

Hmmmmmm.  $30 seems a bit expensive.  How big is the chip?  What kind
of packages will be used?  3 volt or 5 volt technology?  How much
current will it draw?  I think there are many practical questions
that haven't been answered, especially since this chip already exists!


OK, I've got a big problem with all of this.  How in the world do you
expect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved
in this programming procedure?  2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at 
a time:  give me a break.  And how long does all of this take?  Even if
it is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to 
turn out 300 of these things.  How long do you suppose it will take to
program those 10,000 chips mentioned above?  This is highly impractical!


So where can I find info on this AT&T device?  What kind of vocoder
does it use?  Does it require ISDN phone lines?  If not, is it full
duplex?  How does it sound?  What kind of synchronization scheme is
used?  Will all other little black boxes have to conform to AT&Ts choices
of protocol, etc.?  Will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that
conform to these specifications?

   I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX
   platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,
   or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?
   ""Motif"" includes Xt in this context.

Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal.

   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something
which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't
be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this
as an alternative.

   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
   yet have the spec)?

Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you
looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD 
widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list
you could port.

then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution
provides a ""Bill of Rights"" from which most if not all legal rights are

comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right

Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate
from your own reference frame. There's no inside and no outside,
there are just two polarized views. As for statements inside the
Bible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications
for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the 
few books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out
of line with the rest of the OT books, and there's a chance that
someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.


This operates the other way around as well. You have to understand
the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical
relativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is 
pretty hard to continue with a dialogue. I'm not a perfect Christian,
however about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided
me with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame.

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 6: Public-Key Cryptography

This is the sixth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.
We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.
Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu 
as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography 
FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers 
every 21 days.


Contents:

* What is public-key cryptography?
* What's RSA?
* Is RSA secure?
* How fast can people factor numbers?
* What about other public-key cryptosystems?


* What is public-key cryptography?

  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and
  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext
  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some
  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so
  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed
  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.
  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie
  and Hellman in 1976.

  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to
  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than
  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,
  and you don't have to worry about spies.

  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an
  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,
  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the
  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.

* What's RSA?

  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and
  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at
  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.

  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples
  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,
  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We
  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.

  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as
  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair
  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a
  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.

* Is RSA secure?

  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.
  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization
  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to
  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that
  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by
  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,
  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to
  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and
  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative
  results.''

* How fast can people factor numbers?

  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra
  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three
  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;
  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The
  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a
  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers
  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in
  any case.

  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple
  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n
  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,
  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100
  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.

  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few
  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are
  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from
  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number
  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic
  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)

* What about other public-key cryptosystems?"

No.  I recently bought an LC II with a 14"" monitor.  The monitor comes with
the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
most larger Macs.  Since the LC II doesn't have one of these outlets, there
was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
the monitor.  But it was in the computer box, not the monitor box.  It's
not as if the cables are particularly expensive, though.  $10-$15 at the
most.

Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.
It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.




Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have
paging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is
cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more
memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).


The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from
0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the
same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed
(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is
lousy.


The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come
out. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.


Just some view, not much figures.

Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT,
that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk
controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format
program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from
debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it ""knows"" about.
Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you
can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a
third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like.

IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug

Always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings
is not problematic.

But, as you put, Being the source of ""all"" existence, including one's own,
would mean that God came from nothing, a concept alien to Christianity and
Theism.  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and
Contingent existence.  God exists necessarily, always.  God created
contingent beings.  This is a coherent solution to existence, so long as
the concept of God is coherent.

Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).

You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the
Classic Example, but there are probably others.

Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By
looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises
you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.

The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:

1: How does it work?

2: What evidence is there?

The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to
evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on
reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the
organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are
supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or
energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.
(Always beware the words ""channel"" and ""energy"" in any spiel put out
by an alternative practitioner.)

The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is
anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in
mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of
rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done
and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.

The word ""licensed"" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by
whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and
requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong
plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove
and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license
extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be
told that it means ""(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist"".

BTW, the usual term is ""herbalist"".  Why use a different word?

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was 
very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even
compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.
McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.
So on & so forth.

I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor.
Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.

And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I
also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three

important a part of the myth as the story itself.  Thus, I can think of

""Muslim"" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not
all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)
exist in ex-Yugoslavia ""Christian Muslims.""  Tito defined the Muslim 
nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:
Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. 

Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, ""Muslim""
is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who 
differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not 
a ""Christo-Slavic"" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it
was the ""Atheist Communist"" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was
no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  

The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all*
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements. "

54274,"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]

Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day
with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.
It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,
whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from
wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.

Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to
remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been
checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the
people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of
""election fraud"" to hold their jobs.

Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and
sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and
telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too
many cases, who they were).

Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and
discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a
delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater
of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was
being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or
ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.

The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner
Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's
hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive
husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole
our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an
inadequate hearing room.

One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.
He said, ""Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is
always so organized every year.""  I got a little pissed, and replied,
""I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.""

At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a
demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the
pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his
mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and
several Simon's Rock anti-gun ""close-the-loophole"" protestors.
(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)

The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were
about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers
from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got
closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A
cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the
crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker
was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.

Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet
saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up
to ""support GOAL's position"" on ""all bills.""

First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to
testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students
had some curfew, I guess).  

Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long
guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of
his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to
non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock
folks called the current law a ""loophole"" and wanted it closed.

Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his ""SKS assault rifle.""
The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well
that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,
and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery
corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed
that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was
lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining
states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state ""as strong as""
that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.

Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  ""In some of
these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!""
(Oooooo!)  ""We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if
only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't
be having this situation -- but they won't.""  (Naughty, naughty!)

Next up was Boston city councilman Albert ""Dapper"" O'Neill.  He was
there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's
reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's
almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the
ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were
judge, he'd give arrestees their ""last rights"" (pun intended) on the
spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)
He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the
right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(

Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a
CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a
restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining
order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction
-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor
of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,
""I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to
get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have
convicted.""  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous
performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.

Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable
every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated
purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.
""Revenue has nothing to do with it.""  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some
congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that
it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the
vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn
card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the
law-abiding instead of the crook.

The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.
Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both ""restraining
order"" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any
bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He 
was a co-sponsor of one of the ""restraining order"" bills as well.)  One
of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was
vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in
the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, ""every
year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...""
It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been
more effective.

At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.
Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because
the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was
disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had
to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the ""public""
testimony; the other got a seat this time.

Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the
state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.
He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that
his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great
quote: ""If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state
computer system until 1999.""  (This was also an argument he used
against the renewable FID card.)

Testimony was heard from several ""battered women,"" one of whom had
been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he
got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and
said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General
Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how
50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women
needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was
granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether
the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be
satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather
than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long
rambling circumlocution in response.

Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks
something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining
orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue
restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they
think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining
orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.
Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.

Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a
restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she
countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have
allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.
One of the junior reps noted that ""this is America"" and we have to be
certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga
reiterated this, saying that ""people who abuse smaller people can go
to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating
conviction with a restraining order.""  (Point and match, Senator.)

Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his
citizenship ""expired every 5 years,"" and that a driver's license was a
privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.

A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice
system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public
hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death
penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public
hangings.  The speaker then responded, ""I'll make you a deal.  You get
me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.""

Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher
testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that ""he
wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was
outside"" without his evil gun.  She said that the ""loophole"" should be
closed to prevent something like this from ""ever happening again"".

Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of
spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually
shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,
saying, ""As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are
safe -- support gun control.""  The committee was reluctant to grill or
correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had
claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  ""Only residents can get
FID's,"" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no
idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut
out-of-staters completely off?)

Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as
written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by
out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could
be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary
somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino
underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident
student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental
record.

One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy
a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was ""elitist"".  Another
(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents
from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union
had ""FID-type"" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home
state was ""not enough.""  One pro-gun speaker replied that this
resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,
""Everyone's out of step but Johnny!""

All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony
for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the
other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and
GOAL's position) were:

o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull 
   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)

o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)

o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly
   opposed)

o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws 
   (opposed)

o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)

o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)

o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)

o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)

o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)

Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining
pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.

Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger
lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee
to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.

Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.
Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,
""This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.""

The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it
could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It
ended at about 6:30.

I'm for the moment interested in this notion of the 'leap of faith'
established by Kierkegaard. It clearly points out a possible solution
to transcendental values. What I don't understand is that it also
clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any
transcendental direction is equal. 

In other words I might not jump off the cliff mentioned above,
but at the same time I will decide to what direction I will go.
Actually I will do it just now.

In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god
make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every
one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then happens, is
that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't ask to be
created. 

Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (which
has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to
expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?

Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so
righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?

58946,"Subject: Re: Eugenics
/
;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. 
;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will 
;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic
;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.
;No breeding, no ""hybrids"", etc.  The ethical question is, should
;we?
 
Two past problems with eugenics have been 
1) reducing the gene pool and 
2) defining the status of the eugenized.
 
Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted
genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to
crowd out ""garbage genes."" This may in the future become possible. Even if
it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully
mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy
later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa
and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We
don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The
reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred
domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,
meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,
etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible
available is a good strategy for species survival. 
 
Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out
as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make
""philosopher-kings"" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)
want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their
kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually
realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,
it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen
to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing
new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before
""1984.""   
 
I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2
problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to
use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That
hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which
have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also
many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own
power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the
fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their
turns came.
 
Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off
the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global
warming or whatever could and may still do that, too. 
 
The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think
man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any
better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we
may not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of ""garbage"" people out
in some backwater with otherwise long discarded ""garbage"" genes which will
pull us through. 
 
I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.
Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his
lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,
and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God
in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue
needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have
died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough
input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed
themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the
ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit
to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes
thus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. 
 
In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new
technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in
some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the
Spirit.

Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,
outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In
this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point
of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,
then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which
may make you headache.

The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the
successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then
it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.

My experience tells the second method is relible.

Hope this helps."

I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) 
was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost
payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from
2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing
with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now
I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the 
successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early
results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in 
Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue 
their development. 

The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton 
is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D
which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about
launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which
are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things
up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile
thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.
Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know 
how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while
bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
and erected on the pad?  

They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads 
(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course
any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the
US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political
problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention. "

                exit(1);
        }

I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP
9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change),
both running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on
HP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the
combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request.

As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give
a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the
visual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What
am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the
same error.

Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they
think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our 
culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather
than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer 
an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to
treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to
their liking, off they go to another one.

I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different 
perspective on the ""church choosing process"". It seems to me from 1Cor 12
that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all
but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better
question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where
God is trying to place me.

If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they
go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of
God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they
hop from natural family to family.

If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an 
easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more
like an orphan. Prayerfully go and ""leave yourself on a few doorsteps""
and see if anyplace feels like home. 

I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you
have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand
there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking
for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand
if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that
wherever you go. 

In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that
talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is
expanding on that base."

Natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no
actual conspiracy is required.

Put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he
quickly covers his ass.

This, too, is completely natural.


It looks that way to me, too.  But you have to understand that it's NOT 
the first time they have instigated raids like these.  The most recent
one ALSO ended up in a long standoff, but it wasn't quite as public
as this one, and they didn't kill quite as many people.  Maybe this 
screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more 
residences in this manner.  But probably not.


I assume you're talking about Philadelphia.


If you're a fan of conspiracies, the time to make that batch of
popcorn is AFTER the screwup, when it's time for the coverup.

Two safeguards:

1. The FBI could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow
agencies, and associate it with a particular court order;

2. If the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue
closely. It is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal
wiretap is the person the court order covered.

Putting it another way, this question is not very different from the
pre-clipper question ""What's to prevent the FBI from getting a court order
to tap Al Capone and then using it to tap Jonathan Livingstone Seagull
instead?""

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because
of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for
other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy
and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were
killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions 
lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,
peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to
mind...

I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers
of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally
intended for.

That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is
just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in
the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in
religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many
people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own
stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to
kill by their leaders.

The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often
lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant
side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching
between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  

@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest
parts of Man's history.@

Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological
social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.
The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups
with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to
further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these
were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious
persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more
powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples
because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over
religion that he does not have many choices.

Suffering from a severe case of myopia? No Muslim left alive - not a 
single one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman 
border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman 
Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who 
assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman 
parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces 
who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname ""Murad"", 
especially ordering that 

         'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in 
          whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children 
          also should be killed as they form a danger to the 
          Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]

Another former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian 
guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately,
in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all 
the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy 
conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a 
telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in 
April 21, 1915, ""thanking it for its services to Russia."" The Armenian 
newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly 
reported in May 24, 1915 that 

""only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.""

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State 
are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:

	""The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State
	governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public
	peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;
	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental
	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.""

Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing
the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The
fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be
attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.
The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.
Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force
only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.

The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and
the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution
of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing
the power of the Parliament and the government.

The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the
occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was
abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the
occupying forces.

During the Independence War, the ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" held their
first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new
Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish
Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new
Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal 
backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a 
multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by
others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been
based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national
sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.

""Major Principles of the Constitution""

The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic
within the following principles:

- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by 
  law;
- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,
  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;
- The language of the State is Turkish;
- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.
  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;
- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This
  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;
- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;
- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the
  Turkish nation;
- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,
  sex, or political beliefs;
- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.

""Structure of the State""

In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the
principle of ""division of power"" to create a balanced and self-controlled
system. The power is divided into ""legislative power,"" ""executive power,"" and
""judicial power,"" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each
other (self-control).

 A. Legislative Power:

 The ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" is a parliament with one House, elected
 by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on
 behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:

 - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;
 - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;
 - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;
 - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;
 - to ratify international agreements;
 - to grant amnesty or pardons.

 Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral
 or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is
 divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is
 calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age
 of twenty-one can vote.

 Elections are supervised by the ""Supreme Council of Elections,"" which solves
 all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local ""Board of Election""
 runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the
 Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among 
 independent judges.

 B. Executive Power:

 The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government
 as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:

 - to represent the State and the Country;
 - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;
 - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;
 - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;
 - to ratify laws and government decrees.
 
 The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven
 years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may 
 call for a referendum.

 Executive power is exercised by the ""Council of Ministers,"" headed by the
 Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the
 members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval
 by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their
 program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)
 Ministers in the Council.

 Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent
 ""administrative"" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or
 functions against any law.

 C. Judicial Power:

 Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can
 instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be 
 discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the
 reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories
 of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:

 - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The 
   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice
   upon the appeal of the parties involved.
 - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime
   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in
   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.
   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the
   high administrative court.

 The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the
 ""Constitutional Court"" if they contradict the Constitution. If found
 contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.

  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.
Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be
attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes
XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24
bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to
support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to
use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).

  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a
Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest.

20866,"There was a recent discussion of Dungeons and Dragons and other role
playing games.  Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and
science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor
and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science
fiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special
interest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a
special interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic of
discussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are no
arguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is are
not likely to be reading RFT.)  Anyway, I am now working on the April

requests should include a snail-mail address.

38237,"I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.

Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the
accompanying documentation:


                              DMPEG V1.0

                       Public Domain MPEG decoder

                           by Stefan Eckart


0. Features
===========

DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:


 - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard
   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)

 - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display

 - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)

 - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale

 - color-space selection

 - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required

 - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)

 - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
   VGA and many Super-VGAs

...

4. Technical information
========================

The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].
The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]
(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero
coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT
(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'
algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main
difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to
use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).

Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to
+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed
over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points
is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.

Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve
on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas.

the MIT shared memory extension.  The shared memory segment
gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem.
But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage,

    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except
for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you
about the LW Pro design.


    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy
it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB
SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily
available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just
fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are
generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure."

20973,"Some thoughts:

[A. On the non-pacifist side:]

(1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable
than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have
no right to turn someone else's.

(2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have
made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the
army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.

[B. On the pacifist side:]

(1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army,
or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear
whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.

(2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at
combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.

(3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.
Often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available
to the general public.

54012,": I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the
: distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?
: 
: Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
: and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),
: and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.
: --------------------
You might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems. They
work best for close work( 1 mile and under).

RF is used for much longer distances in two major modes. Transponder and
phase measurment. Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station
and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the
receiver time.

Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the
same frequency signal multiplexed in time. A receiver can pick them up and
measure the phase shift between signals. Maps can be drawn that plot the
Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two
stations. "

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                           BY DEE DEE MYERS

                          The Briefing Room


9:47 A.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Okay, today's schedule.  As you know, the 
President jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.  
	     
	     At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the 
Rose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award.  At 1:30 p.m., 
he will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.  And at 5:00 
p.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel.  There will be a photo 
op at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards.
	     
	     Any questions?
	     
	     Q	  Is he moving towards some major decision this week 
on Bosnia?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  As we've said, he's continuing to discuss 
his options.  He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy 
advisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.  
He'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll 
continue to discuss it.  We don't have any specific timetable, but 
obviously the situation there is very serious.
	     
	     Q	  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's spoken to her today.
	     
	     Q	  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly 
except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 
p.m.?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He did.  He answered a question about it 
yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  Before anything had happened.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Before anything happened.  He put out --
	     
	     Q	  Since something has happened he's had nothing to 
say.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's put out a statement on it last night.  
And we'll have more to say about it later today.
	     
	     Q	  In what forum is that going to be?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden.
	     
	     Q	  He will talk about Waco at that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, he'll have something to say.
	     
	     Q	  Is that something we can take live?
	     

	     MS. MYERS:  I think it will be brief.  We can talk a 
little later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I 
don't know if it's something you'd want to take live.
	     
	     Q	  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as 
well?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.
	     
	     Q	  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the 
Attorney General?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know 
that he hasn't talked to her this morning.
	     
	     Q	  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or 
anyone else?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  And he didn't talk yesterday?
	     
	     Q	  What's the reaction to her resignation statement 
that she made last night?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she 
answered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of 
asking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her 
100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He 
takes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind 
Attorney General Reno.
	     
	     Q	  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told 
that he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much 
he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and 
the justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of 
that, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the 
compound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else 
was going to succeed, et cetera?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about 
the decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led 
to her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision 
to go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.
	     
	     Q	  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back 
now, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision 
he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at 
what actually happened?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is 
lost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the 
decision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was 
informed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 
percent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the 
FBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone 
on for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their 
lives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.  
	     
	     This was a very difficult situation and all the 
decisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the 
ground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving 
forward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the 
best possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-
guessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --
	     
	     Q	  Why not?  They have to --
	     

	     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I 
think it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  
I think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at 
this -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, 
it's not useful.
	     
	     Q	  You sound like he's going to order an investigation 
of what happened and whether --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that 
later, yes.
	     
	     Q	  He will order an investigation?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to 
say about an investigation.
	     
	     Q	  What kind of investigation?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.
	     
	     Q	  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely 
there is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right 
decision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned 
out to be a rather -- a debacle.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review 
the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  
I don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, 
again, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and 
we'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.
	     
	     Q	  What was the FBI Director's role in this?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting 
up the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were 
on the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke 
to the President, but I'll double-check that.
	     
	     Q	  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of 
planning and so forth?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what 
aspects he was involved with.
	     
	     Q	  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House 
today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe 
that she'll be here.
	     
	     Q	  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on 
on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in 
terms of -- to the President's detriment politically?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people 
wouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I 
think, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate 
the facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  
But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of 
decisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused 
by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four 
federal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent 

children lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes 
the tragedy of the outcome.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling 
the, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was 
talking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at 
Justice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of 
thing?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end 
of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the 
news conference once there was a point at which there was enough 
information, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had 
transpired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of 
levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department 
and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening 
there.
	     
	     Q	  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the 
President, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to 
anybody at the White House.  So who --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-
staff level.
	     
	     Q	  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department 
was handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, 
Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked 
to a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a 
number of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into 
exactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number 
of conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to 
keep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its 
ability as events unfolded throughout the day.
	     
	     Q	  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he 
talked -- he may have at one point.
	     
	     Q	  And was the White House role just to seek 
information about what happened, or was it to direct the public 
information campaign that followed?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation 
so the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice 
Department managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very 
interested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the 
President was following it very closely throughout the day.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was 
following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet 
Reno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her 
this morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on 
throughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  
He's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning 
before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written 
statement.
	     
	     Q	  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to 
her personally yesterday?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've 
spoken this morning.

	     
	     Q	  No, yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung 
out to dry all day yesterday.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said 
throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that 
he stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President 
stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts 
full responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that 
Janet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they 
could, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the 
time.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her 
1,000 percent.
	     
	     Q	  One of the best indications of that is to pick up 
the phone and tell her.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken 
this morning.
	     
	     Q	  Why can't we find out?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here 
right now.
	     
	     Q	  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do 
is pick up the phone.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney 
General on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered 
or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to 
increasing pressure on the Davidians?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  
Again, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly 
she told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it 
was entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was 
happening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he 
gave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was 
that she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She 
informed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't 
know how much clearer we can be about that.
	     
	     Q	  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the 
responsibility.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.
	     
	     Q	   Does okay mean --

	     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate 
responsibility.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's 
going to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the 
administration?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.
	     

	     Q	  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any 
congressional investigation?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the 
incidents that occurred yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully 
with any congressional hearings that would be held?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  
One that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had 
a bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children 
may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either 
left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  
What do you know about those two --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts 
this morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know 
-- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by 
people who came out of the compound.
	     
	     Q	  Has the President received any report today in 
terms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've 
been able to find out on in the compound now?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that 
they've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it 
to cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported 
in the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney 
General Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from 
the so-called experts?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands 
behind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of 
her advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he 
supports that.
	     
	     Q	  What about the validity of the decisions made on 
the ground?  Does he back those --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions 
made.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the 
decision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the 
President says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the 
decision?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed 
about the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility 
for it.
	     
	     Q	  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the 
decision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated 
the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department 
and FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision 
and then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the 
chain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The 
operation went forward, and the President accepts full 
responsibility.
	     

	     Q	  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to 
go back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that 
came through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or 
with his involvement?  What was his involvement?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice 
Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General 
and the Director.
	     
	     Q	  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many 
different ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by 
the Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney 
General in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, 
I want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who 
made the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you 
know, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The 
Attorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about 
those decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to 
it, and he accepts full responsibility.
	     
	     Q	  Do you have, based on what you know here at the 
White House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during 
this --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.
	     
	     Q	  Along those same lines, just in your initial review 
of the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come 
from not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having 
an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?    
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do 
with it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went 
forward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet 
Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to 
speak to Clinton?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her 
responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I 
think she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.
	     
	     Q	  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed 
on the situation in Waco?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a 
daily basis.
	     
	     Q	  Who briefed the President?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, 
what conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on 
the events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.
	     
	     Q	  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a 
White House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House 
staff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into 
exactly who briefs him on what subjects.
	     
	     Q	  Another subject?
	     
	     Q	  On another subject.
	     

	     
	     Q	  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.
	     
	     Q	  How close are you to signing the biodiversity 
treaty?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech 
on Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.
	     
	     Q	  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where 
yet.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would 
you characterize the speech tomorrow?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day 
speech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past 
positions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much 
into what he's going to talk about tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  On or off campus?
	     
	     Q	  Is this at a location outside the White House?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We 
don't know exactly where yet.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President 
talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? 
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll 
try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.
	     
	     Q	  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today 
-- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, 
that the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration 
still believe that it can work and that they will sign on?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of 
peaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the 
administration is considering a wide variety of options at this 
point.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of 
Eastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with 
his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.
	     
	     Q	  Is that a question they're going to try to be 
deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of 
options, including the peace plan.
	     
	     Q	  Does the group that he's meeting with today include 
Reg Bartholomew?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be 
among the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General 
Powell.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent 
encounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating 
the no-fly zone?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.  I'll get back to you on that.

	     
	     Q	  Will the President be meeting with every one of the 
leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, 
with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with 
the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.
	     
	     Q	  As a group, or one by one?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and 
Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for 
quite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of 
state that are here.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he 
supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been 
worked out for him to address the march on Sunday?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some 
kind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact 
details of that.
	     
	     Q	  Not a live phone hook-up?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting 
to Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to 
the other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on 
it.
	     
	     Q	  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what it's on?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --
	     
	     Q	  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  
When will he be meeting with the President?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll 
talk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, 
but exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.
	     
	     Q	  So he's not going to come immediately to the White 
House?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.
	     
	     Q	  Drug czar?
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect it before the march?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the 
Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.
	     
	     Q	  Why not?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.

	     
	     Q	  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.
	     
	     Q	  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on 
amendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is 
committed to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  
And we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where 
we end up.
	     
	     Q	  When this briefing is over can you give us word 
through the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to 
Janet Reno?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.
	     
	     Q	  It's become a pressing question for the last 
several hours.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, 
and I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.
	     
	     Q	  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered 
a compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the 
best alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a 
second look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that 
today, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the 
Mitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that 
will be at the march on Sunday?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the 
President.  I don't know who yet.
	     
	     Q	  Well, has it been decided how he's going to 
address?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but 
there hasn't been a final decision on that yet.
	     
	     Q	  The official will read the letter, is that what it 
sounds like?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.
	     
	     Q	  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you 
know what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come 
up, but it was about economic issues.
	     
	     Q	  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the 
target?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.
	     
	     Q	  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress 
speech at the end of May --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the 
President will present the health care plan to the people.  I 
wouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made."

	Whats the difference between a V.32bis modem and a V.32bis modem?

Absolutely.  I just meant that no secure *dedicated* crypto device has
ever been given approval.  Guerrilla underground devices should be well
possible with today's high-speed modems (not that I can think of many v32bis
modems that are approved either mind you - just the overpriced Couriers)

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 14.4K?  I think it is; I've heard it's not.  Lets
say 8 bit samples.  Would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable?  If not, how fancy does the compression need to be?"

61133,"Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome
monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted
Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz
horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've
studied it.

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship
to reality.

IMHO this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.
 
I do not like a God who prays to Himself.  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed
to Himself  --   let's get real, if the scriptures say He prayed to the
Father, then the Father IS someone different than the Son.  I have no
problems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scriptures
co-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him.
 
Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.
When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God.
 
If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God.
If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God.
 
But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this
mission?  You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence.  




Pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.  

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less
than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain
and reschedule the EVA's in that time.

More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and
AXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle,
there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a 
resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources aren't driving directly into each other. 

Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing
high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,
etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing
line-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.

20696,"Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or
a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can
never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to
this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He
desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If
the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this
cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and
women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.
Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification
was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept
Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on
the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people
expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what
kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different
world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age
could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on
the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would
have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to
live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to
wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized
and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his
return.  It's been almost 2000 years.

And the two simplest refutations are these:

(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that
the recorded ""impact"" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain
being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years
after the supposed event.

(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).
Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one
gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really
guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did."

I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I
couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice
on how to repel wasps.

   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care
of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we
couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie
for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or
spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?
Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
else.

   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem
to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in
them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon
as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.

Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they
seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about
wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful
stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use
hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me,
and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only
two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and
close all doors and windows. 

NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.

I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning
guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff
Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his
frame.



I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that
Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.



I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back
problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're
cold, its a hitch. 


The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable
with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses
track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was 
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
he's changed his stance so much.

I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits.

There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book ""Sinus Survival"", always gives,
before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his
new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times
in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over 
2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief
of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his
program.

In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly 
written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which
I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also
*greatly* improved in other areas as well.

Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to
molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus
since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000
question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was
from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.

BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.

In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee
their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned.

This is too often true.  Many people try to place this as a ""higher""
sin.  However...


A big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people
advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider
(active) homosexuality a sin.  I don't often see the attitude of
""forgive me and I will try to change"".  Instead I see ""there's nothing
wrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who
have an illness because you don't accept me"".  Christians can and will
accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.

Sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it
is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born with
a desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  It's
much less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in
anger.  There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful
desires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church
when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after
several years.

Chelios is by far the MVP on Chicago...


Manson, by his own admission, had a terrible year...the Oilers
don't really have a team MVP...by default, it should go to Craig
MacTavish.  Shjon Podein was the biggest surprise...Tikkanen the
biggest disappointment.


Tinordi was back by mid-season last year...and when he plays he is the MVP.


King had a great year last year also.


How can Kovalev be a surprise?


Fence-sitting...look at Philly's record with Eric and without...
there is no doubt.  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.


Tocchet had a near 100 point season in Philly with Mike Bullard as
his center...why shouldn't he be able to do that with Mario?


Really Joseph deserves the MVP nod.

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The ""large""
grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with
fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the
thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating
efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long
wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate
the energy they have absorbed.

Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100
microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer
wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In
the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable
by any conceivable observation.

Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a
population of ""small"" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50
atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to
temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool
quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_
the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small
population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed
""average"" temperature.

A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has
three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal
dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust
(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At
the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are
respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly
doubled in the ecliptic plane.

To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution
factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then
take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from
Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent
to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work
could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a
dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be
cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of
starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave
background, and I believe that to be correct.)

                         Dilution   Temp.   DT^4
Microwave background         1        2.7     53
Galactic dust              2E-5      25        8
Zodiacal dust (emission)   6E-8     280      369
Zodiacal dust (scattering) 3E-13   5500      275
Starlight                  1E-13   5500       92
                                           -----
                                             797

The fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K.  Outside the Solar system, the
result would be 3.5 K.  

I find these results surprising, especially the importance of
Zodiacal dust, but I don't see any serious mistakes.

104687,"I stopped going to A's games some years ago while I still lived inthe
Bay Area for exactly this reason.  I believe the length of their games
has been institutionalized by LaRussa/Duncan.  They encourage their
pitchers to be overly deliberate, to throw to first often, to study
the catchers' signals, and so on.  And almost every A's hitter takes
a step out of the box after every pitch.  This is not, imo, a coincidence.
This is planned.  And I hate it.

As for the Gant situation, I did not see the game or the replays.  But
I do wonder.  What if Gant had requested a time out?  Would Hirschbeck
have been required to give it to him?  Could he have denied the requst?
For all he (the ump) knew, Gant could have had dirt in his eye.

As a followup to my post let me add that:

I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance.
However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the
application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from
within an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their
site-specific ""batch profile"" into a dataset within our product, specifying
the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,
etc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is
written to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and
run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as
the job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the
interactive session.

As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80
characters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in
batch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a
problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.
MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single
command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is
*STANDARD* with OS/2).

The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not
within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.
Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party
companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.
And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative
script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption
that they have anything other than what comes with NT.

I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like ""Is vi
available for Windows?"") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and
***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is
it a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites.

One last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,
i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run
there.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific
commands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment
on these commands, I would appreciate it.

Thanks again for the help,

Very sensible.




Must you rave so? Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in 
disgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am
really sorry if that fact bothers you.



More ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.


Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?


""PAINFUL SEARCH ..""

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about
600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.

The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000
dead.

The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a
15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali
Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the
bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr
Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead.""

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old
lawyer said at his small office.

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 1990.

Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70
miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.

Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage
of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours.""

Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's
report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six
policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the
names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The
most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27
February.

""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream
and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot.

""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and
one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return.""

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces.

HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES

AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the
Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.

""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,""
the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to
be alive.""

Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity
for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh.

""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy
machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the
snow into a forest on the other side.

To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.

""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his
group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman
son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his
67-year-old elder brother.

""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,""
he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We
have never got any of the bodies back.""

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.
One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing, Mr Sadikov said.

Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and
several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy
hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.

As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee.

""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.
They even found a bullet in my sock.""

Hojali massacre in February  (left). Nurses struggle in primitive
conditions  (centre)  to  save  a  wounded  man  in  a  makeshift

relatives in  the town of Agdam  (right) weep over the  coffin of
another of the massacre victims. Calculating the final death toll
has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 24
hours.

	     Q	  Mr. President, President Havel is here for the 
Holocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night.  All 
this focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision-
making process as far as Bosnia is concerned?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the Holocaust is the most 
extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing.  And I 
think that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that 
should be opposed.  You couldn't help thinking about that.  That's 
not to compare the two examples.  They're not identical; everyone 
knows that.  But I think that the United States should always seek an 
opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against 
inhumanity.
	     
	     Q	  Sir, how close are you to a decision on more 
sanctions on Bosnia?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, of course, we've got the U.N. 
vote.  Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to 
strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough.  And we now are 
putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at 
what other options we ought to consider.  And I don't have anything 
else to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on 
it and will continue to over the next several days.
	     
	     Q	  Following your meeting today, sir, are you any 
closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there?

come and see me.  I'm glad he's here in the United States for the 
dedication of the Holocaust Museum.  He is a figure widely admired in 
our country and around the world, and a very important person in 
Europe, and a very important person to the United States.  So I'm 
hoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic 
and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we 
believe in."

The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was
presented as evidence that she was a prostitute, and the court
apparently found this compelling.


Clayton does indeed know the difference.  Greg apparently doesn't.



Because the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the
Marines were engaged in self-defense.  Got it, knucklehead?



Because, in part [REPEAT AFTER ME], ""the judge found that there was
some credible evidence that the Marines were engaged in self-defense"".
Hopefully, one of these days you will understand.


With respect to credibility, I would rate Clayton Cramer an order of
magnitude higher than a) the news media, and b) homosexuals.


Clayton is indeed consistent.  And so are you."

But the impressive performance of the Graphite was
not its Winmark, it was its Wintach result (esp. the paint
performance). Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly
imagine that there is a cheat driver for it."

	  The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free
   will in any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows
   everything that is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and
   are able to change what happens to us.  However, since God knows
   everything, He knows all the choices we will make ""in advance"" (God
   is not subject to time).  Too often arguments pit predestination
   against free will.  We believe in both.

That last sentence of Steve's is an important one to remember.

There are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot be
completely comprehended by a human being.  Were this not the case, it
would be good evidence that the religion was man-made.

In the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things that
would at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of God's
will over all things, and man's free will in deciding his own fate.
Catholics believe in both!  But that doesn't mean that anyone has come
up with a pat reconciliation..."
58844,"

But why do you characterize this as a ""flight of fancy"" or a ""fantasy""?
While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious
that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This
does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of
fancy or a fantasy.


Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also,
""extra-scientific"", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of
rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble
over what a ""surprising"" experiment is, what counts as ""surprising"", etc.
The same may be said about ""logical grounds"".  My point is that quite frequently
(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to
previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of
some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples
such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his ""sea of air""
hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) ""surprising""?
Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must
be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)
out of ""perfectly rational grounds""?  Well, there was a pretty successful and
well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.
The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty
at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it ""new""?  Well, one
could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new
domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you
like."

 I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today. The cost is $299, but there
 are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone
 916/737-1550. He doesn't have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about
 graphics. Seems like he may have a decent package. It's an Object Pascal Framework
 that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes. 
 I'm going to check it out and see if it's got what I need for my CAD package.

 I also found another package: 3D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle.
 The number is: 206/868-5418, also no email. The package is strong at ray tracing,
 I'm not too sure about its geometry creation tools. I also need to look into this
 package some more. I also spoke with the author, Mark Owens, another nice
 guy that seems to know his business. The price is $249, no royalties."

                      TUTORIAL PROGRAM
Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on 
Tuesday, July 6.

12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer 
 Scientists""  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)

This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.  
Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material, the ""central dogma"" of gene expression, and selected 
other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology.

12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists""  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming 
languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge 
representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background, 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. 
Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry.

3:00-5:45pm ""Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis"" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory) 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic 
views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain.

3:00-5:45pm ""Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming"" 
 Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)

The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly 
non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an 
extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will 
also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications, and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught 
this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in 
the field.

3:00-5:45pm ""Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis"" 
 Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) 
 & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, 
represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order 
syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area 
of word-based analyses.

NETWORK RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of
    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In
    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three
    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent
    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these
    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to
    special 'servers'.

    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of
    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.

    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central
    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In
    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for
    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more
    specialized mailing lists described below.

    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin
    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews
    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a
    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are
    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',
    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called
    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends
    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby
    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so
    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet
    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was
    posted.

    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and
    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not
    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more
    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make
    it the preferred option.

58858,"INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language
courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and 
Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses 
each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin 
June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours 
per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  
Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact 
Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology
Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or
address below.  
ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.



  

#######################################################################
#################   New Program Announcement   ########################
#######################################################################


            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and 
January 1994.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:

1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time.

2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,
Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.


3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,
and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

   I will buy a Honda Civic EX Coupe.  The dealer ask $12,750 for it,
including A/C ( installed ), but not including stereo, tax, registration
fees.  I live in Mexico, so I don't have time to go to a lot of dealers
and compare their prices.  The dealer is in McAllen, Tx.  Is this a good
price for that car ?  If not, how much should I pay for it ?

   Please e-mail ASAP if you don't want to post.  Thanks a lot.

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by
Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be
read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has
a built in compression scheme (LZW?).

IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package
images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was
created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.
It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.
The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved
BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.

Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats
(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)"

	sizes, the rights of people to have their own standards,

Well, as funny as your little comment may seem, it has very little to
do with your personal privacy as a citizen, and about the governemnt
being able to look at everything you have ever typed into a computer
at one point or another.

This ""Clipper Chip"" stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the 
Nightmare on Elmstreet cheese-on-celluloid movies look like episodes
of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by
everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments
and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is
only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the 
affore-mentioned article)!

the gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
for this Clipper Chip made.  Hell, they probably based the encoder on the 
chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a 
classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.

I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support 
organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this
Clipper Chip in any way that I can.

I do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search
warrant, to my keys... and I don't want those keys to be only 80 bits long
to begin with!

103386,"I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX (non-turbo) last year.  I had a 
question on gear/rpm ratios.  Right now in 5th @65mph I'm at 
2600-2700 rpms.  @70mph I'm at about 2900rpms.  Is this about the
norm?  I'm an auto neophyte so I'm just wondering if these are
the proper ranges?  Somehow the rpm figures seem high.  A friend of mine
just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta (2.8l V6.)
Also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model Z?

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

Hope this helps."

[stuff about British cult members deleted]

They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a
shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells.

Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides,
the ranch house (not ""fort apocalypse""; it was just a house despite what
the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The ""Gun loonies"" couldn't hardly
have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.
The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there
to put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*
under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't
even tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that
the FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in
this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.
Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.

Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media
and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it
up as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American
people will probably believe them.


This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that
is becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns
*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On
the other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal
guns then the government did have the right to search their compound.
But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons
hasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke
any laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this
is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.
The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol
violations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should
stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of
their jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.


Sounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults
alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are ""heavily-armed
religious wackos"".

David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out
peacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON
THEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause
this senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE
LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.

 
Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the
cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that
it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on
fire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions
of committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.
Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED
EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still
don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the
Waco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.

 
You're wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They
had MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic
pistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later
retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.


Gun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in
Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then
they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns
me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government
seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are
becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.  This
greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well.

Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!

We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they
intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,
we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would
have ever thought it would happen here!

I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.

And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses
tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.

Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.
Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a
half of civilians.

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm
either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.

1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)

2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center
perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
the sphere.

3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This
gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.

4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to
any of the original points.

I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)


An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting
at a point. This might be easier to implement."

51 Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally
The Miami Herald, April 11, 1993

   Melbourne, Florida --   [...]

   Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits anti-abortion pickets
   within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice.
   Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.

   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment
   to the Constitution.

   ``This is our sidewalk,'' said Joe Carroll, 33, a landscaper who
   marched with his children, Mary Grace, 8, and John, 7.

   ``I am not a rescuer.  I am not a trespasser.  It's just that this is
   my sidewalk.  I am not really protesting abortion.  We are protesting
   denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech.  This judge is
   trashing the Constitution.''

   The children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as Carroll and
   his father were arrested.

   Outside the clinic, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Washington,
   D.C.-based Feminist Majority Foundation, called for the Florida
   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's
   order, which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties.

   ``This cannot go on,'' she said.  ``This is not freedom of speech,
   this is total psychological warfare with violence.  It is ridiculous
   to have to ask clinics to go court-by-court . . . to get protection.''

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.

The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot? 
In a new Civil War? 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper.  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your
history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
(or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history.

That's not very good odds.  

Somebody once said something like: ""Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in
agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.""

Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the

   Memoirs of the chief Armenian delegate to the Paris Peace Conference
   were published in the Armenian Review Magazine in 13 articles from
   Volume 15 (Fall 1962) to Volume 17 (Spring 1964). These memoirs 
   include an interview between Aharonian and British Foreign Minister 
   Lord Curzon in which above-mentioned genocide was discussed. The 
   official report mentioned by Lord Curzon is the report of British 
   High Commissioner to Caucasia, Sir Oliver Wardrop.

                     whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children 
                     also should be killed as they form a danger to the 
                     Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."" 
 (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of 
 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

               === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===

This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general
description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and
some suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting'
will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of
newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos
groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't
understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at
least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please
subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the
documentation provided there.

Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:

rec.autos.tech

is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,
construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely
inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.

rec.autos.sport

is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving
automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,
spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.
Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)

rec.autos.driving

is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.
Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert
your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.

rec.autos.vw

is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,
Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing
list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as
a mailing list.

rec.audio.car

is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and
so is mentioned here.

rec.autos.antique

is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years
old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)

alt.hotrod

is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the
rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing
performance vehicles.

alt.autos.rod-n-custom

also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar
American hobby of customizing older cars.

alt.autos.karting

for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.

rec.autos

is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.


Crossposting:

Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed.

Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular
audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector
articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are
almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or
rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.

Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually
inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is
truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.

Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of
radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.

Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
rec.autos.

It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of
articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to
misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these
three.  The life you save may be your own.

Distribution:

There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution
field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.

The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, 
the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the
following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article
headers, and on article content.

1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford
Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in
either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange
reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)

2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which
your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences
between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,
all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel
injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These
differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.
Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation.

3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;
in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas
Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos
reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.

4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when
possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can
(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state
abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted
to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put
""ny,nj"" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated
values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area.

The Dangers of Overgeneralization:

To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:
Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is
true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly
different from those in Idaho.

The Need for Adequate Specification:

When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;
e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,
model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be
quite useless.


Concerning Lemons:

At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all
`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from
the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information.


Concerning Flames:

As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section
of this posting):

If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a
minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and
you'll get exactly what you deserve.

If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe
bald, unsupported assertions.

Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.


Asking the Question:

It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please
send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to
end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest
I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses
to this request'.

Answering the Question:

If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.
Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --
it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly
address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see
your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
self-righteous.


Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:

Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of
them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings
about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some
of these topics include the following:

1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con

2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
    radar detectors.

3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.

4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why
    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue
    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)

5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's
    right to own and operate a radar detector

6)  `Buy American' discussions

7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates

8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible

9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?
      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the
          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.
          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]

Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the
chip; the real message encrypted with the ""conventional"" key, and the
serial number and encrypted ""conventional"" key encrypted with the
(IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of ""one key that millions of
people use which can't be changed"" doesn't seem reasonable) ""family
key"".

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine
which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number
and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on
this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session
key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.

Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other
attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed
so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant
receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how?
What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent
bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored
""proper"" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's
wrong?

I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip ""sends"" that
information out many times in slightly different ways, making it
effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information
being sent."
59232,"rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (HSP's) and DNA.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.

HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they
are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY
protein- because it's DEAD!  

Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be 
completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.  

Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.

My advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better
to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your
ignorance.  Don't speculate, or at least get some concrete information
before you do!

Yes and No. ESPN2 will be launched as early in September. Cap Cities
are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up
base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.

The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the
merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannel
will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCI
and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will
do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the
NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC
and ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime
SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams."

		A meta-exegetical or methodological essay




I look forward to reading it.  When I got to the library last week, it
was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared
over the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un-
fortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn't get a
look at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve
my own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly
work, and I can hope that REXLEX's posting may give some meat to chew on.

However, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues
-- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.
If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better;
if not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.


writes, _in abstractu_:


	[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has
	already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that
	the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and
	NOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the
	article as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]

The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and
b) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The
questions I wish to raise are

	1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?
and	2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the
	     discussion) that it is correct?

Note that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),
which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the
literature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,
Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless
you have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound
methodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-
ate text to ""fix"" the coinage's meaning for his audience.

As yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm
or reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat
plausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way
of construing this problem passage.)  I'm going to set aside for the moment
the question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the
more tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,
two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,
we can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outside
that to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to
derivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning.

The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no
internal evidence for Paul's meaning.  He uses the word totally without an
explanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of
negatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.

We are left, as the only ""internal"" clue, with the etymology or formation
of the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before
him) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with
other men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (""lie"" in
Leviticus, ""bed"" in Greek).  One problem is that ""bedders"" (_-koitai_) is
not, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one
serious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:

	o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much
	   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies
	   ""men who have sex with X""  [obviously, the ""best case"" is to
	   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]

such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.
It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-
standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition
of the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesis
correct -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or
not original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible
of comprehension by his readers.

My ""test"" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT
in his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his
readers to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)
or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that
they can guess his meaning without too much floundering.

External evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographic
or social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into
the picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,
which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by
a contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-
ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one
has grounds for

	o  denying that Paul coined the word
and	o  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning

Do you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his
readers to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and
its intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess)
understand him to be referring to the Levitical ""universal"" prohibition
of male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized
at least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --
how else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled
back from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah
law to his gentile converts!)

Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined
the word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or
Ionic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be
assimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than
usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What
is Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?

And if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in
his list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for
his readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no
other.)

I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by
this word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,
had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and
explained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of
evidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.

So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.
And it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.
I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about
the word:

	a)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe
	    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities

	b)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual
	    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their
	    part with the Leviticus passage)

	c)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an
	    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not
	    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application
	    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER
	    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me
	    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.]

Of these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but
I still have reservations about that, too.

If the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence
of depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it.  If it does
appear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior
use (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should
normally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they
can be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In
either of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relation
to the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be
from the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight-
forward!

There is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid
us in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as
good as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).
But it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don't know about you, but I
for one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means
be convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he
says elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this
same character (Romans 14:22-23)

	""Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and
	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going
	against his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt
	is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done
	in bad faith is a sin.""

For my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of
_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by
the nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty
of constraining Paul's own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and
all the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --
and sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you
to God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul's
words HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort to
contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.
I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I
read him ""in the large"", if I can see him lay out his position in detail
and hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his
meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)

In my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first
of my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm
that Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as
the Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-
thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and
for later Christians.  Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night's
meditation :-)"

20548,"THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?

                   by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.
                              (1894-1977)

          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about
     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:

                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son
               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief
               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall
               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him
               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and
               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall
               rise again"" (Matthew 20:18-19).

          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,
     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving
     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He
     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious
     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that
     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual
     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly
     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*

          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the
     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted
     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise
     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.

          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-
     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-
     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.

          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth
     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and
     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which
     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against
     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had
     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and
     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the
     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some
     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the
     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,
     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back
     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and
     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the
     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came
     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them
     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).

          How did this tomb become empty?

          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--
     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological
     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*
     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by
     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb
     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the
     chimney at Christmas time.

          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down
     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa
     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the
     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.

          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-
     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by
     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.

          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,
     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar
     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)
     that the women went to the wrong tomb.

          The facts are these:

          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to
     which by mistake they could have gone.

          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or
     more people to forget the place where they have buried their
     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women
     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to
     the wrong tomb?

          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?

          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the
     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.

                  Now when they were going, behold, some
               of the watch came into the city and showed
               unto the chief priests all the things that
               were done.  And when they were assembled
               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they
               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,
               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole
               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to
               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and
               secure you.  So they took the money, and did
               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-
               monly reported among the Jews until this day
               (Matthew 28:11-15).

          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the
     fact that the tomb was empty.

          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never
     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to
     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.

          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that
     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples
     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*

          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?
     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.

          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject
     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the
     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away
     the body of Jesus.

          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in
     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to
     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His
     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there
     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,
     then proved.

          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would
     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.
     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most
     of these men did.

          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ
     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it
     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed
     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing
     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today
     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.

          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to
     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to
     what had happened to Him.

          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.

          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning
     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-
     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He
     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that
     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper
     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).

          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at
     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren
     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the
     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-
     8).

          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-
     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed
     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are
     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the
     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the
     appearances.

          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our
     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are
     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest
     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.
     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;
     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of
     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president
     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.

          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has
     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:
     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.

          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He
     claimed to have come down *from* God.

          He said He was the way *to* God.

          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.

          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one
     else had it.

          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to
     us.

          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed
     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*

          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe
     that His words are all true?

          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us
     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?

          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead
     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some
     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.

          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all
     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For
     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-
     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a
     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day."

The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to ""citizens"",
but it makes several references to ""people"". For example, Article IV:
""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated""; Article V: ""no person shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by
a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law""; Article VIII: ""excessive bail
shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
punishments inflicted"".

Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens;
aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.?
Whether slaves were considered ""not human"" I don't know, but it seems
that a case could be made that they weren't treated as ""people"" as defined
in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the
Declaration of Independence which states that ""all Men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"",
it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition
of humanity.

I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
""storys"" about them. OK ?
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
         It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
         energy that carnot will give them.
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,
         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment !
         
   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-
         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with
         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the

         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have
         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and

Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins
on the HST re-boost mission.  A while back i had asked why not carry
the EDO pallet up,  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough, they weren't even carrying extra suits.


Where's wingo when you need him:-)

COme on.   Knock that S**T off.

YOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning
for the repair EVA's.   Also during theøÄ   
Intelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations.
I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.

And as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it
bad enough.

YOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do
is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.

Don't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate
missions slip,   the Discovery won't launch on this mission until
March.  that's almost a year.


Ah,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.

YOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are
getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.

The time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally
planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA's  with 3 reserve
walks.

If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million
saved.  If the Weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days.
and  handle any contingency  problems,  that's quite a savings.



Of course,  there wasn't any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too.

as for the problems with the aperture door,  I am sure they can
work out some way to handle  that.  Maybe a Plug  made from
Frozen ice.?   it'll keep out any contamination,
yet sublime away  after teh boost."

I don't think so.  I think  most NASA food products were designed to
be low fiber 'zero-residue' products so as to minimize the difficulties
of waste disposal.  I'd doubt they'd deploy anything that caused whole sale
GI distress.  There aren't enough plastic baggies in the world for

No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the
modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by
the modem.


Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other
hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport 
( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,
you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be
used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.

I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as  
perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,  
and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. 

Something was VERY wrong with that scene.

Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of  
fellow humans dying.

Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think  
they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was  
the sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,  
in fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his  
followers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there  
any scenaro that justifies all that death?

And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  
not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  
the edge.

And that's if you buy the latest version of the ""story"" hook, line, and sinker.   
I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment  
to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.

Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no  
witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they  
had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  
building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back  
the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.   
Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any  
other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

Gawd, I love Windows :-)


You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them
fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.


You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a
swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky
stuff in a PC environment.


A reasonably accurate prediction...


Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:

There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,
and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined
notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.

The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,
and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not
important right now.

The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find
the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the
number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it
holds a ""magic"" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad
(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster
contains the next section of the file.

The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.
The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is
doled out in ""chunks"" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster
is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.

To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the
starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.
Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will
tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.
Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump
around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a
time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker
which says it's the last cluster in the file.

CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of
the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into
submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to
double-check anything it ""fixes"".

Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:


All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match
the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter
the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the
directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.
But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,
obviously, are made up.))


Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached
to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these
""lost chains"" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK
through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell
CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply
be marked ""available"" in the FAT.



...


These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,
one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that
C:\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...

To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.
This will ""fix"" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.
Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to
assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  ""Missing pieces"" are
likely to be found in those ""lost chains"" at the top...)


Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of
the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an
amount which exceeded available disk space...

In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.
There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage
after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the
problem occurs.  Sorry.

15885,"brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid, and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate.
It's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service. 
I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government,
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys.


But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?  
If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.

If the user is the buyer, what's the service?  
Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service!
Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!

If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying?
The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine -
I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key!

Face it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want.
The only people who want it are the government, not the users.
What you're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes,
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax
(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)

I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency.

Here in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees.  There are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people
refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective.
If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, there are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee.
Something could scratch the paint, after all.

60279,"Hi Netters!

I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about
my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:

1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).
    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both 
    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / 
    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5"" and 5.25"" floppies.

2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).

From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these 
options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees 
any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking 
(I don't know very much about these beasts):

1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.
    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?
    What do the floppies themselves cost?


2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a
    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any
    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?
 

3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)


4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or 
    recommendations for manufacturers?

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 1: Overview

This is the first of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read this part before the rest. We
don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.
Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

society which serves the National Secu---uh, no. Seriously, we're the
good guys, and we've done what we can to ensure the completeness and
accuracy of this document, but in a field of military and commercial
importance like cryptography you have to expect that some people and
organizations consider their interests more important than open
scientific discussion. Trust only what you can verify firsthand.

77818,"Well everybody,

After reading tons of notes by Serdar, I have come to the following conclusion.   
Turkey is PERFECT, and no Turk has ever made a mistake.  He has proved to me at  
least that the land occupied by Turkey today, was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by  
Turks.  (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople)  They treat their minorities  
like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked  
them.  Somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder  
their population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note,  
Armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  I want to go  
to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible, that  
has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (Amnesty  
International must have bad sources, Turkey would never torture its citizens,  
treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who  
incidentally are still missing), what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A  
TURK!!!!

Now back to reality.  I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to  
ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia  
of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE!  Anybody at  
all who has believed ANYTHING he has said, please step forward.  Let him know  
he hasn't been wasting his time, that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by  
the volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. Well I am  
off now.  I will go dream  some more about that perfect place, that nirvana,  
that utopia, that xanadu, that TURKEY!  "

In order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy
within the region of 2.6 to 2.8 electron Volts. According to my physical
electronics prof, you can't get an LED with that band gap. That's why you
don't find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs. That
is not to say that blue LEDs can't be found.  I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold,
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering.
They didn't emit very much light...

It's also what you say when you're waiting for the end to come in a 
""fiery apocalypse""...just a thought.

Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the
timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of
wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything ""new""
that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going
to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't
it be more ""reasonable"" to believe the BD's would set the fire early
after the assault began?  

The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting
of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I
was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter
(watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least
one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.
Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of
the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been 
penetrating a few feet."

38758,"OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
(for better or for worse).

I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
switching.

A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
even more..."

Sorry, but I'd have to differ.  The Canadian-bashing wrt to the health 
insurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting.  Having
kept up with this debate on the net for some months, just about all the
criticism of the Canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even
the anti-Canadian propaganda put out by the American insurance industry
and the AMA.  

In a few cases, such as Mr. Case, the critiques are well-reasoned and
worthy of response.  Most others are misinformed, illogical,
or just plain dumb.  I don't think the same can be said of the ""American
proponents"" of the Canadian system, much less of the Canadian proponents.

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  
trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  
and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  
to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  
place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  
that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  
wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  
could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   
It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  
wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  
correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  
my NeXT that way.

Your might take a look a PLPLOT.  Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0)
can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot 
directory.  

--Mark

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 From the README file of version 4.99c:

 This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for
 many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size
 and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard
 x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,
 bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
 may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different
 line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of
 distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in
 the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek
 alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts
 can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device
 drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile
 format and renderer.

 The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.
 The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly
 granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without
 consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT
 object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it
 is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely
 available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed
 somewhere in the documentation for the package.

 We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of
 user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any
 published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,
 which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that
 as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the
 kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest
 in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only
 afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on
 those which help us get our work done.

 PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically
 without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub
 routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any
 modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the
 header file ""plplot.h""; see the documentation for more details.

 The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of
 several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex
 plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
 the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
 there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  

 At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:

	 Unix:	SunOS
		 A/IX 
		 HP-UX
		 Unicos
		 DG/UX
		 Ultrix
		 SysV
		 Linux

	 Amiga/Exec
	 MS-DOS
	 OS/2
	 NeXT

 For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:
  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual
  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

This is an interesting point.  As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can
figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods.
(The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that
sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell
thousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones
are in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the
cost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.

I don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.

53325,"Once again, this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling
between some software cracks...


[Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an
 apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn't actually
 have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn't matter to what
 follows]

I don't know whether I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back
to current affairs,


Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone
else dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you
will, known (according to Umar Khan) to ""Every Muslim school boy and
girl"", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.


Yes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing
about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing
the actor ""Gibreel"" in the role of the angel whose name he took.
Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims
or implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like
stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed
prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the
Arthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens
of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,
consider Salman Rushdie's children's book ""Haroun and the Sea of
Stories"" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific
storyteller -- works with existing story lines.


No.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in this
part of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's
intent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and
satanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied
(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:

    "" *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker
    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.
      Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,
    staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's
    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't
    know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my
    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.
      Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.
      Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.
      God knows whose postman I've been.""

It's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?
Or something else?  The answer is not given.

To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the
role of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,
but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very
existence of a newsgroup named ""alt.atheism"" raises the same
questions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is
the real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is ""filth
and lies"", and he ""asked for what he got"", are we next on the fatwa
list?  (That's a rhetorical question, of course.)

	The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece
of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the
outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously
suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I
suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline
very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines
(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most
common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and
tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of
the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive
algorithm that would let you step in and say ""no, dummy, you're going the
wrong way"".

	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his
doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).
A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized
micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.
This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with
its auto-trace tool.

	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he
was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a
good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future
analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem
since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the
virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be
restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,
clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real
life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult
this problem is to solve in the general case.

	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while
on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last
known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no
bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some
sort of fall or accident in the woods."

as Timmy Baterman's father in *Pet*Sematary* could attest, so after 40

PGP is not available on the archive site rsa.com.  If it were, it
would be highly amusing, since rsa.com (actually Public Key Partners,
but it's the same entity) is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually ""make, use or sell"" PGP.
I believe those patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent
lawyer or anything.

There is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which
can be used in North America without legal entanglements.  You may
wish to consider RSAREF, however, which *is* available from the FTP
site rsa.com in /rsaref but probably doesn't meet your definition of
""freely redistributable"" (it's readily available in source, in C, and
does RSA, MD5, etc. and comes with a license allowing noncommercial
use.  Like any other strong crypto software, it's not exportable
legally.  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI, which a
number of people have received in the past.)  For reasons that aren't
entirely clear to me, RSA says that only U.S. people should take
RSAREF from its server, although there aren't ITAR issues regarding
Canada.  The RIPEM distribution site (ripem.msu.edu) has RSAREF in its
distribution, and is OK for Canadians.

# 
# #historians, mainly Southerners, who sought to divert attention from the

# #the argument is specious, at best.  More recent scholarship from the 
# #last 20-30 years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton/sugar/
# #tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in 
# #the South prior to the Civil War.
# 
# This is because the South did not receive the massive momentum of capital
#  intensive growth that the Northern states did. Compare the Northern
#  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference 
#  in the capital to labor intensity.

Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that
capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.

Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not
in 1850.

# #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's -
# #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the 
# #South.  
# 
# That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because
#  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without
#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have 
#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come 
#  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile,
#  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and
#  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing 
#  agriculturalists. Those that insisted on keeping slaves because of their
#  ""Cruel Hearts and Hatred for Black People"" would have been driven out of
#  business. Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_
#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.

This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt
that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive
threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the
maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local
governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside
capital investment in the Southern states.

52744,": I've started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission

From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are
protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube!]

{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have
them.}

Suggestion: look in the RS data book. They have several RS232
transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the
LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
ask me why. I've never used them before.

I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions.
I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain
types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to
here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that
curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'
is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the
word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his
Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.

Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):

The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is
much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.

Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:

The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is ""obvious""ly wrong to
be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry
which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us
for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was ""forgive
them Father, they know not what they do.""  Knowing how forgiving Jesus
has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of
love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause
foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.

It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to
address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out
there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with
AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would
frame a response something like this:

""It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is
simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment
for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his
children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We
will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the
opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with
all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our
sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life
for him.
 Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not
to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart
or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through
the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men
that they may perhaps reach out and find him.""

The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears
of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is
actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the
earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been
expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your
perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.

You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people
because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and
I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the
city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some
brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so
that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.

The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual
contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their
salvation in that there may be repetence involved.

The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's
commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or
misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to
prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,
is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or
husband.

I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.

   Neither (1) or (2) apply with the government, though. The feds, unlike
Apple, have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which
to hang your freedom. Why?  Because unlike Apple in (2), the govt has no
credibility to lose. I'm serious about this. One can name just about any

Does this algorithm depend on the fact that the scheme is secret or

True to a point.  If you were to ask a Buddhist atheist...



Actually, yes and no, Hell is eternal death.  Actually, the way 
     I've had it related to me, it's more of an eternal damnation,
     where sinners will feel the licking flames of Hell.  If I
     supposedly can feel these flames, I would assume I'm still
     alive, but suffering and away from God.


I believe Jehovah's Witnesses have a similar view, where the body
     sleeps for ever...

I don't have a problem with being condemned to Hell either.  The
     way I see it, if God wants to punish me for being honest in
     my skepticism (that is, for saying he doesn't exist), He
     certainly wouldn't be changing His nature.  Besides, I would
     rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven
     knowing even one man would spend his ""eternal life"" being
     scorched for his wrongdoings...

The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of
the orbit of Mercury.

The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed
perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to
Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations
and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later
improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system
of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune
and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit
of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was
afoot with Mercury.

But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate
it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly
curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915
and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics
of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian 
geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of
it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession
of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's
numbers rather than Leverrier's.)

Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent
efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar
have been fruitless.

Yes, in fact Peter is now at Wycliffe HQ in the U.K., and is a member of my

passion for serving Christ.

I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower
of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In
fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply
_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the
troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to
unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief
that resulted from frustration with God.

The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through
most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these
would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to
continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do
mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between
me an atheism from time to time) would fail.

The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and
the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my 
life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of
this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor
have I ever been, ""on fire for Chirst,"" and I don't think I ever want to be.
Nevertheless, I am not ""lukewarm"" about my faith, so I don't really
fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety
about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of
internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,
but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because
all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a
destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal
strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no
responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.
Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a
very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called ""people of God"" are
behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go
that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.

IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-
hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God
wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and ""shut-up-and-do-what-
you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-
you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet"" courtesy of some of Christ's
more overzealous followers.  

A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a
very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to
Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had
for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,
Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich
did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help
them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were
thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the
emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost
Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed
hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of 
their own moral view.

There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time
to go into them right now.

Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the

Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I
believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this?
Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which
you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are
attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.
Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you
because your god doesn't exist.


I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.
What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.


Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain 
knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the
Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and
there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond
our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  
to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a
person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find 
something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one
will gain with that attitude is folly.

Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages
in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even
though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.
Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such
deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. 
I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, ""You will never
be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.""


From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):

    ""It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.""


Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:

   ""No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.""


And in John 3:16:

   ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
   life.""


You are included in ""whosoever"".  And I also pray that the Father is
drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting
to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the
making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure
stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became
on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.

You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because
you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack
Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,
proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.

Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would 
probably say to you: ""Satan would surely like to have you.""  Why so?
Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great
moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task
he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the
faith to walk on water as Jesus did.

Saying ""hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y"" is *much* different
from saying ""hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y.""
Here you've made both statements.
If the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy X, then
perhaps policy X is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement
is not something to base policy decisions on!


According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly
the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you
think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the ""leading causes of
unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other
means as causes of unintentional death.  Can't you see past the bullshit?


Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the
anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by
firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use
these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I'm
sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning
accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,
but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun
control measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.
The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may
be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.


Sorry if it wasn't clear to me.  I thought you were waffling on your view
of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully
preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on
all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who
aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to
commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a
positive way for police to respond to ""interpersonal violence.""


What, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit
suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL
METHODS per year?  Who do you think I should believe?  The people who call
everyone up to age 24 ""children"" when they're screaming about the ""carnage
of our nation's children"" being caused by handguns?


Ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be
such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People
2000 document is to ""enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of
handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the
likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?""  The
agency that funded the ""study"" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban
had saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of
a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?
It wasn't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their ""post law""
period...



Okay, I'll concede I no longer have the numbers I once read on these.  I'll
retract my dispute of your numbers.  However, I would be greatly interested
in seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers.


What's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary
school I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a
problem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also
been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the
car, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  The problem is not the guns,
it's the parents!!!


And what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns?
NOTHING.  No criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even
suspension.  They take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say ""ain't it
awful,"" and go on as if everything's back to normal.  What's wrong with
this picture?


I don't think Koresh was the Messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that
if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he
believed the children were much safer inside the compound?  I didn't say
he was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what
he thought was going on.  He thought he had them in the one place where
harm *wouldn't* come to them.

No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to
a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants

I, some years ago, almost became a victim of this.  Squirted a fair amount in
an old model 15 Teletype which was acting up, then turned it on.  The eruption
when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular... I almost got
my eyebrows singed, the plastic (old ones had safety glass) cover over the

20541,"Were the early Christians weird?  Yes!  So were their non-Christian
contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome
or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the
creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero
worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.

You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of
Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a
simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.  
Sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they
do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible
unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom-
mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book
_The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in 
Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?

And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian
century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in
the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.

What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to
understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love
you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to
love one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic
attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and
the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too*
heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))

I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and
it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of
early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian)
cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious
problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory
and ironic.)

But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and
love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under-
standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin
to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other
words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most
especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians
and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some
of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

Humanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person, and we killed Him.
Fortunately for us, this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy.

I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 Imams with you, although
my preference would be to move the discussion to another
newsgroup.  I feel a philosophy
or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply
embedded in the world view of Islam and the
esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter
into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric
religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical
substance of man's being and nature.

A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory
books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's ""Fundamental's
of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe"" - Mizan Press,
translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book
(if you can find a decent translation) is ""Wilaya - The Station
of the Master"" by the same author. I think it also goes under the
title of ""Master and Mastership"" - It's a very small book - really
just a transcription of a lecture by the author.
The introduction to the beautiful ""Psalms of Islam"" - translated
by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of
Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We
have these books in our University library - I imagine any well
stocked University library will have them.

From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You
should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable 
Shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the

Sorry Charles...According to the National Safety Council, ACCIDENT FACTS,1991
""In 1990, gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death
for children ages 14 and under.""
 
 That thinking is so screwed up, I don't even know how to respond to it.
A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt
to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.????????????????
So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she
were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25
through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease
LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease,
chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles,
that makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart
Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational
and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES
of death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation
and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.
Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.
 
I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents
group or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't
confuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many
victims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree.
I'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of
childhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond
to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who
wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths
is trying to make a political issue out of it.
 
 
 Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context
for your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually
in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed
concern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane
person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined
as ""a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest
number of childhood deaths.""  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I
am inhumane and irrational.
 
Sorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting
the facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, ""Firearm murders
of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990""
 
Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state
that ""Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun
accidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded"".
 
Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say ""Gunshot
wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas
between 1987 and 1990.""
 
Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state
that ""Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from
1986 to 1988.""
 
Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly
victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't
realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go
into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll
by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious
that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion
and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political
discussion.  I really don't want to do that.
 
 Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC.
They don't just study cancer and heart disease.  I've got news for you,
interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health
problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.
 
 
WHO THE F**K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE
FIREARM CHARLES??? In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump
into a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1
sentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here???
You're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control
issue out of a discussion that isn't.
Charles buddy, I'm getting really tired of this.  Do you live on the planet
Mars???  As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact
with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local
urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition
spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard
gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,
whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and
whether they themselves have ever been shot.
 
Believe me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION."

	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol

	that ""This"" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
	fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular

	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate

    Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who
die young, etc. ?




   But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is
something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.



   I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond 
bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe
they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand
that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows
that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want
to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,
but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die
a final death))

   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_
sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and
not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that
there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. 
(assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll
never know I'm dead. Hmmm... 



    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:
 ""At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now."" ?

    Consider the following statement:
 ""At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.""

    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, 
it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. 
Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any
conscious experience whatsoever). 

    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning 
to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort 
of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to
be conscious throughout this eternity. 

    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the
product of propaganda (""Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?""
It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.
Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all
animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of
super-survival. 

 

    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,
I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to
convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_
by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. 
""Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?"" asked an
Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something
to the effect of, ""Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?
Scram."" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an
account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no 
immortality).

The original RISCs had small instruction sets, and simple ones. The
idea was that a) every instruction should be completable in a single
clock cycle and b) to have no microcode and c) extensive pipelines.

A few comparisons (from Patterson: Reduced Instruction set computers.
CACM V28. 1, 1985):

CPU		Year	Instructions	Microcode
---		----	------------	---------
IBM 370/168	1973	208		420Kb
DEC VAX 11/780	1978	303		480Kb
IBM 801		1980	120		0
UCB RISC 1	1982	39		0
Stanford MIPS	1983	55		0

While researching for the VLSI VAX, DEC discovered that 60% of the VAX
microcode is there to support 20% of the instruction set which
accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. The uVAX 32
subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software
emulator for these very complex instructions, the full VLSI uVAX
included the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but
only ranm 20% faster.

A couple of folks have suggested the ""corn connection"".  In the five month
period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  I checked
the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  She has also never had a problem
eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day
with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  I do believe that
Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops.  But
the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
wonder.

Thanks for checking into this.  All information at this point is valuable to me.

"
59572,"Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A(
retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by 
high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The 
types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells 
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing 
process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond 
to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't 
know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are 
capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major 
breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin 
A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using 
vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go 
on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on 
your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done, 
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing 
loss if there really is one."

Funny about that... my wife (my girlfriend at the time) used to get sick 
after eating certain foods at various Asian restaurants, and never knew 
why.  She'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously.  A couple of us 
ventured a connection with MSG, and her response was: ""MSG?  What's that?"".  
It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and 
chips... which I noticed (later) had MSG on the label.  Don't know about 
double blinds, but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurants.

I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  Now, how is it such a grave
mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons?  Or are you claiming that we shouldn't
sell any weapons to other countries?  Straightforward answer please.


Who benefits from arms sales?  Hint, it isn't normally the gov't.  It is
the contractor that builds that piece of equipment.  Believe it or not,
the US and UK don't export the huge quantities of arms that you have
just accused them of doing.  Arms exports are rare enough, that it
requires an act of congress for non-small arms to most countries, if
not all.  Do you believe in telling everyone who can do what, and who
can sell their goods to whom?

is on the daughterboard, or does it involve getting a new daughter-

screen(not pretty I know, but possible?) And of course, what would
the damage be ($). Any info would be appreciated.

   I don't think Joe was saying any such thing.  However, your question
on ""asking Jesus to come into your heart"" seems to imply that infants
are not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be
viewed by some people as a sort of ""prodigal son"" type of thing; i.e. a
sudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly
accepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly
after birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does
a man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my
experiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built,
including one's relationship with God.

   Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a
ritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the
recipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ
it is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself
bestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption
into God's family on the soul."

Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.
However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all
five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against
muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do
not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and
open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know
that
historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone
by the death penalty.

My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the
law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate
long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no
precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly
levelling death penalties for apostasy.

I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of ""fasad"". This
ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an
Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was
not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.


I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was
levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication
of the book. However, the charge of ""fasad"" can encompass a
number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations
broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that
the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from
circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the
""crisis"". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not
the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are
levelled at people, not books.

The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the
issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,
presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of
secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people
crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. 
Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost
his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then
Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while
protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily
concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again
attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this
point that the fatwa on ""fasad"" was issued.

The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of
Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of
the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant
will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa
against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The
crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being
played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media."
103112,"I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurance
companies in California to get estimates. I asked for the same
coverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you
according to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.
Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's
what I found (for a '93 Integra GS):

AAA: ~$2000/yr.
State Farm: 2614.92/yr.
Allstate: 1220/yr.

AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about
$200-300 back at the end of the year.

Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm
wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be
suspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.

If you were omniscient, you'd know who exactly did what, and with what
purpose in mind.  Then, with a particular goal in mind, you sould be
able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance
with the general goal.


In an objective system, there are known goals.  Then, actions are judged
as either being compatible with these goals, or not.  Simple.  The problem
with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.  That is,
the goals of each society are different.

Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one.


I've said it many, many times.


Which part do you have a problem with?


But, we can enslave the animals, right?  But just not kill them?  Or
are you a vegetarian for health reasons?


No.  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant, anyway.


Of course not.  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species
for food.  It might be nice, though, if the other animals were not made
to suffer.  For instance, a cow in a field lives out its life just about
the same way it would in the wild.  They seem happy enough.  However,
the veal youngsters aren't treated very well.


I don't know.  What is the goal of this particular system?  There is no
inherent system.


Nope.  Again, it seems okay to kill other species for food."

  Or, for that matter, with the USA.  Around here, nobody reroutes
  freeways to avoid churches, synagogues, and so forth.  They just
  get condemned, paid off, and the road goes through.  The same is
  standard policy for any number of other public projects: schools
  and sports arenas being only two examples.

shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,
and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being
stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a
rock. 

Also remember that a lot of teh ""draft 1st"" stuff comes from the assumption
he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that 
Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock
by any means at this point.

It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his
signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos
suspensions.



No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not
leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to
use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not
when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make
an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can
convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).


My cut on things as they stand today:

	(it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him. I don't
	believe they draft him to keep him).

Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters.

Next question.


The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters
to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.

The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to
attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had
had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type
raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.
It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity 
to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead
he ordered the murder of the children.


In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive
the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the 
suicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given
the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met
by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter
claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the 
AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes
they were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons.


The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were
quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any
time. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have
achieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of 
magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes
and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch 
apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties
than 80.

Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious
risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the 
question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over
a prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared
Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go
in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.


Can you think of a better way of getting the children out?

A 100% certain way?


The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for 
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require
them to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through.

This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its
agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the
middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.

Still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that
WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in 
resolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a 
comparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it
could be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it
rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular
the person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF
agents and 17 children on his or her conscience.


There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society
preach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the
very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO
may not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group
of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example
and holding several hundred children hostage.

The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent
them arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation. 
this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power
weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah
to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.

...about the protests over proposals to put a giant billboard into orbit,



Mr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  In short,
an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.

Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they are
more like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer
can somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash."

       The Republicans are, in general, fighting any tax increase.
There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase
incrementally.

       (BTW, what is different between Canada's tax and most of
Europe's that makes it ""visible?"")


       This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congress
enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that.
(Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd 
have a difficult time ""forcing"" anything like that.)


       Primarily because it's a practical impossibility to ""freeze""
tax rates.

       However, this is something that bothers me.  We're always talking
about ""consumer confidence"" and ""consumer spending"" as gauges for the
economy.  If they really are important, wouldn't shifting taxes to
consumption provide a disincentive to spend money?

  Your information on this topic is very much out of date.  Quantum Electro-
dynamics (QED - which considers light to be particles) has been experimentally
verified to about 14 decimal digits of precision under ALL tested conditions.
I'm afraid that this case, at least in the physics community, has been decided.
Laymen should consult ""QED - The Strange Theory of Light and Matter"" by Richard
P. Feynman and for the more technically minded there's ""The Feynman Lectures on
Physics"" by Feynman, Leighton and Sands (an excellent 3 volumes).  Case closed.

Each team is owned by the league, with local intrests controlling day to
day operations.  Working agreements and NHL affiliations are up to each
team.

Each team has a $100,000 salary cap for 17 total players
(16 dress up).

Each team is limited to 11 visas, meaning at least 6 players must be
Americans (Ignore this rule if you are Tulsa, they only had 2 Americans
on the roster during the playoffs).

Teams play in Wichita, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Memphis, Fort Worth, and Dallas.

Future expansion plans include Houston, San Antonio, Baton Rouge, Little Rock,
El Paso, Albuquerque, Tuscon, and Amarillo.  Austin is a possibility if Dallas
has to move.  Houston and San Antonio are in for this fall, with Baton Rouge
and Little Rock likely for 94-95.

Well, it's obvious that you *don't* attempt, otherwise you would be aware
that they *don't* all ""loudly [claim] to be the One True Christian"".

I've tried to avoid using the phrase ""is/is not christian"" because of these
ownership issues; instead, I've tried the phrase ""Nicene christianity"" in an
attempt to identify the vast majority of ""christianity"" which has roughly
similar viewpoints on the core theological issues.  The JWs do not fall
within this group and in fact espouse a position known as Arianism, which is
rejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well."

Indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To 
rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance.
Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on
the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.

Well, that's certainly true in Lotto.  But it has absolutely
NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball.  When you start down
the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.





I repeat.  I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch
hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting
performance.

I do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance
may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed
will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance.
And I think Chris Sabo is such a player.

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not
the result of the natural process of evolution (but rather an ""act of God"")
and then in the same post say that these other processes (volcanos et al.)
are natural occurrences.  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are
natural processes and what are direct acts of God?  How do you know that
God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose
in mind?  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in
the bible.


Adam & Eve (TWO PEOPLE), even tho they had the honor (or so you christians
claim) of being the first two, definitely do NOT represent a majority in
the billions and trillions (probably more) of people that have come after
them.  Perhaps they were the majority then, but *I* (and YOU) weren't
around to vote, and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to
do with that tree.  But your god never asked us.  He just assumes that if
you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad.  Hmm.  Sounds like the
same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting
here resorting to.  So THAT's where they get it... shoulda known.

   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

I'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something
much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.
That particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of
thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.

Once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do
something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road
like Mines-Mt. Hamilton.

In any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she
has proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport
riding."
20907,"My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas
carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and
heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either -
I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.
        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how
religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though
I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -
just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't
definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by
religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to
understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.

        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is
correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian
God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about
people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -
agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their
beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between
the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do
you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow
a different religion than you would if they were Christian??

        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in
the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be
stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??

        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are
fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and
'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find
hard is the actual belief in God.

        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite
believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not
believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why
I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.

        Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came
into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

                        Thanks for the help,

This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'.  You are making claims about what
'is' or 'is not' part of this program.  But if the ""block grants"" go to states
and cities, the mayors list is VERY relivent.
  

Okay scarasm does deserve sacrasm, but I already contact my local officals, my
congress rep., senators, Watch evening news, news programs, and C-SPAN.
  


The fact is that Primetime (TM of ABC) has had numberous reposts on such waste
programs that already exist.  Again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating
the DEBT, we must REMOVE the DEFICIT, and do away with ALL PORK !!!  

There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs 
from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed
that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by 
changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).

True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.  

Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class
to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not 
specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.

The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked
quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as
some other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had
the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want
except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are
considering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we
both think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and
performance were both significant.

Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.

Mazda 626
 + very comfortable and roomy
 + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is
   hard to find
 + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:
   tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat
 - more expensive than many other cars listed below

Honda Civic
 + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
 + comfortable front seat
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)

Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla
 - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 + can get ABS without lots of other extras

Saturn
 + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so
 - motorized attack belts

Dodge Spirit
   no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok
 - rear seat does not fold down

Chevy Corsica
 + comes with ABS standard
 - lower ""would you buy that car again"" and safety ratings in
   Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)
 - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +
   for some)

The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the
626, and in our minds, not significantly better.

We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the ""big 3"",
due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products,
(b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate
of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the
seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts
and no air bag."
54829,"jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:

   Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not
   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be
   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill
   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.
   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but
   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun
   - and would pay through the nose for it.

Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,
homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate
fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall
the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for
use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of
effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of
killing German soldiers for their guns.

Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was
specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.
The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel
tubing, hand tools and a welder.

I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference
between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown
locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I
think the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling
economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the
result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have
firearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one way
or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation."

%By Elias Davidsson - April 1991 (Revision Oct. 1991)

Note - you are already posting ""facts"", some of which are outdated.

The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that
you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful
exchange that might lead to a ""meeting of the minds"".  It is to those
who read with open mind, that I address myself.

%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the
%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member
%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial
%discrimination as ""any distinction, exclusion, restriction or
%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic
%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing
%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of
%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,
%social, cultural or any other field of public life.""

While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,
as the text currently stands I know of no country in which
racial discrimination of some sort can not be found.
It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative
violation.

%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining
%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The
%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since
%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli
%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of
%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United
%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial
%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.

If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative
statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be
applied to any other case where the council perceives some form
of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.

Scarey thought.

%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of
%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native
%non-Jews born in that country. 

Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not
alienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be
correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes
apparent.  This slant permeates the text.

%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas
%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most
%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the
%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.

The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting
Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.
Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the
issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].

%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim
%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant
%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).

If I recall correctly, at the time ""zionism"" took off, there
was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any
factual contradictory evidence .

%But the
%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and
%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the
%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native
%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and
%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could
%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000
%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.

Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on ""most
of their villages""?

%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to
%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their
%political repression and their destitution.

There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later
used for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the
intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was
that this was not the case.

You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded
this.  As you do again, below.

%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied
%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus
%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its
%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered
%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security
%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and
%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these
%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.

Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,
though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.
Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other
annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.

%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,
%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of
%international law and UN resolutions.

Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,
what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories
captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country
previously (other than Iraq) ?

%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under
%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as
%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a
%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).

Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against
on an ""ethnic or racial"" basis.  Therefore your above statement is
incorrect.

I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,
the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.
However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist
at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not
argue racial discrimination during that period!

%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a
%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that
%represents them in world affairs.

Once again, some do, some don't.

%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab
%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant
%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.

Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care
about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you
espouse.

%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the
%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject
%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be
%challenged in court.

Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.
Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all
of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some
are, but this is not due to the ""whims"" of the military as
much as the sizeof the task/organization.

%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied
%territories are permitted to carry firearms.

Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in
Daheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of
the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.

%Jewish settlers have
%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents
%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel
%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in
%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will
%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates
%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish
%settlement.

That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your
purpose is/was in posting this.

%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them
%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For
%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected
%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by
%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish
%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and
%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to
%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in
%practice.

Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,
right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way
you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but
as a result of what actions?

%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the
%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are
%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on
%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these
%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied
%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in
%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews
%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government
%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of
%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;
%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their
%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and
%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian
%children are denied the right to learn their history and
%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end
%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the
%authorities.

1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.
    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no
    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish
    collective.

2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind
    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has
    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large
    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case 
    in point.

3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation
    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously
    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.
    It is based upon Jordan's school system.

4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another
    gross generalization.  

%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of
%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never
%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the
%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its
%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards
%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is
%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs
%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately
%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen
%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of 
%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme
%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in
%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the
%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.

Another generalization, but lets not stop here.
The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,
Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the
territories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,
I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered
previously.

%Although sexual
%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,
%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal
%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system
%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.

When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,
nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious
intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and
the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.

%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on
%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has
%not produced any written Constitution. 

Simply incorrect.
The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the
dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your
contentions to the sidelines.

%Zionism predicates a state
%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,
%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak
%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli
%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be
%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial
%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only
%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the
%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.

But the discrimination is not based upon race.
Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.

%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that
%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -
%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed
%to fail.

Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.
Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as
you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate
shall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the
amount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)

On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by
suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The
doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)

I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the
one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest
route, and so I am happy with it."

Subject: Should Anybody be Permitted to Own a .50 BMG rifle?
Lines: 26

   For the moment, forget about BATF incompetence or FBI hubris.  Did
anybody catch Rep. Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up
a .50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
to own one of these.  (I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)

  So what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda:

1.   A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG)

2.   A ban on ""sniper rifles""

3. A ban on ""stockpiling"" guns and ammunition.


BTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on
     the news. I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning.

""Vote as you shot.""  (19th Cent Republican campaign slogan )


Shumer is not mis-informed, he knows full well what he is doing.

If you look at his other votes, and positions as an agent of redistribution
of wealth & property in this country, to him guns and personal freedom 
are incompatible with his obvious world-view. They are a threat to the
'order' he would impose.

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate 
onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh 
envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. 

You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. 
It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, 
the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. 
That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure 
stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions
(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make 
a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. 

The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur
does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the 
cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be 
done there........



The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it 
lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses 
for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they 
use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's 
do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems 
could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with 
providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill 
this idea. 
"
20817,"Responding to the moderator:


Yes, I agree.  What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith
(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced
of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal
revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those
beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to
accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the
conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs
arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God 
must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would 
honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone 
who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are 
rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient 
for them, or because they wish to spurn God.

I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one 
holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is 
that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with
God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas
of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or 
revealed that truth.

This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction
between real disease caused by Candida albicans and the ""disease""
that was being asked about, systemic yeast syndrome.

There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush.  It also
seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous
may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- I've 
never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before (though 
presumably it would work by the same mechanism).

Candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major
pathogen.  That does not mean that there is evidence that it causes
the ""systemic yeast syndrome"".

On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for
use with the curses library.  Guess what they provide? :-)

Unix Press, ie. Prentice-Hall, has a programmer's guide for these
tools, referred to as the FMLI (Forms Mgmt Language Interface) and
ETI (Extended Terminal Interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  It is
ISBN 0-13-020637-7.

Paraphrased from the outside back cover:

    FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,
    and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library
    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
    for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.

The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a
""shell-like"" environment of the ""fmli"" program and it's database
files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.

The ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide
support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
with controls built on top of the curses library.

C'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. In April 
1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A 
number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas.""

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language
radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]

[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.
[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900
    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg
    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.


The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position. His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.
As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 
1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.

 I refer you to the bonobos, a species of primate as closeley related to

102695,"I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict
the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?

First Base:

Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil
Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,
then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs

Second Base:

Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge
to Cubs...a big edge.

Shortstop:

Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an
automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.

Third Base:

Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.
Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to
Florida.

Catcher: 

Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to
Marlins

Left Field:

Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.
I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves
himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position
where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.

Center:

Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the
Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May
isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays
full time.

Right:

Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does
Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs

Starters:

Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't
remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard
is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs

Middle Relief:

Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.
Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.

Closer:

A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but
no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.
Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with
a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.

Overall, an edge to Chicago.
Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.

He is God.


God granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint.
 

The scientist creates the living creature to examine it, poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour.  He will kill it if it becomes a threat.  For
example, let's say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks
free of its confines and starts devouring the population.  The scientist
would not hesitate in killing it.

God creates us to be His loving companions.  He knows whether we are true in 
our love for Him or not.  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him.
God cannot abide by sin.  By rejecting God, a person becomes an enemy of God,
one that must be killed by Him.  Note:  I say that God and God alone is
worthy to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.  We are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy.

one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into
a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the
one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly.

It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely."

take a chance of having a very bad audio buzz.  This is caused be a ""ground loop"" and the only way of getting rid of this loud buzz is to make sure that you

combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of

recently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous
hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).
I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was
dehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue,
since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general
stamina, so far as I could tell."

funny I guess he got to watch the Ferraro brothers as well.....) I'm
not sure if walsh will go, but if Keenan is getting 700,000 and walsh
even gets 100,000 that's a 30% pay raise for walsh (not to mention

I would guess not.  Dr. Neil Gehrels of CGRO is the son of Dr. Tom
Gehrels of the University of Arizona.  Since he's long had research
interests in asteroids and other solar-system astronomy, Tom is the
one more likely to have discovered  a comet (and thus had his name
attached to it).

Tom Gehrels is a leader in the Spacewatch project, which has recently
increased mankind's discovery rate on near-Earth asteroids (they're
finding a couple every month).  For much more on this interesting guy,
read his autobiography, *On a Glassy Sea*."

I finished reading a very good book, ""The Will of God"", Weatherhead.
This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the
will of God.

Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts;
intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He
(Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael
Parkin above quite nicely.

Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will
is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with,
even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by
circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all
humankind) will never be stopped.

Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of
this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's
intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life
and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and
deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3)
Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the
Cross, as Jesus willingly (""not my will, Lord, but yours"") died for
the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant,
overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.


It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial
will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.



Right, intentional will.

51825,"Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to
ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a
marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at
this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a ""full page"" monitor
for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed
by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook
screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you
would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,
technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen
and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR ""full"" height. 
The screen would probably be monochrome.
The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very
popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word
processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient
to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and
applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could
hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.

Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really
need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me
via email and let me know:
1. If you would consider buying a ""full page"" laptop screen
2. How much you would be willing to pay for it
3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea

Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,
but who knows!), please send me some.

Thanks in advance!!!"
66409,"We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines.
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge)  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are

  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.

  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like
it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,
and isn't.  
  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement.
  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to
live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great
deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the 
male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.
  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great
ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings
and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  
Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism
is an attractive option.
  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)
should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God."
51725,"Here is the story:
I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an
Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh
I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected
to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.

Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,
and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do
the trick.

Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that
there aren't going to be any.

Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers
to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...

thanks in advance."

* What is a product cipher?

  A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak
  operations such as substitution, transposition, modular
  addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block
  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,
  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of
  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern
  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks
  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre
  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product
  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,
  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,
  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.

  The following table compares the main parameters of several product 
  ciphers:

  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds
  LUCIFER          128               128                16
  DES               64                56                16
  LOKI              64                64                16
  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5
  PES               64               128                 8

* What makes a product cipher secure?

  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is
  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the
  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be
  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends
  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown
  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a
  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''
  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a
  complex nonlinear fashion.

  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are
  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES
  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a
  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria
  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be
  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].

* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?

  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.
  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,
  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit
  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit
  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.
  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all
  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from
  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate
  a large subset of S_{2^N}.

  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple
  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a
  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the
  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all
  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)
  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show
  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number
  of rounds.

  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the
  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an
  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does
  not exist a third key K3 such that

  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)

  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys
  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If
  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then
  we say that E is a group.

  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was
  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their
  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a
  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].

* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?

  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under
  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K
  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.
  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K
  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some
  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial
  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot
  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal
  decision is no better than simply guessing.

  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers
  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by
  random boolean functions.

* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?

  There are four standard ""modes of operation"" (and numerous non-standard
  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.
  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,
  published in 1980.  See the question about ""ECB"" below for more details.

  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the ""modes of
  operation"" can be used with any block cipher.

* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?

  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself
  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself 
  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one
  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and 
  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages
  that were authenticated using that key.
  
  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message
  authentication using DES.

* What exactly is DES?

  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product 
  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  

  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].
  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.
  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)
  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. 

* What is triple DES?

  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit 
  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES
  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.
  The ""DES modes of operation"" may also be used with triple-DES.

  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.

  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985
  ""Financial Institution Key Management"" and is intended for use in
  encrypting DES keys and IVs for ""Automated Key Distribution"".  Its
  formal name is ""Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key
  Pair"", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.

  That standard says (section 7.2.1): ""Key encrypting keys may be a single
  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional
  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long
  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
  single key.""

  Others use the term ""triple-DES"" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or
  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).

  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form
  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance
  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on
  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key
  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on
  its own part.)

* What is differential cryptanalysis?

  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be
  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on
  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by
  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the
  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.
  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,
  notably FEAL [BI91a].

  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of
  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a
  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the
  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required
  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required
  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key
  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.
  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many
  known plaintexts.

  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling
  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key
  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,
  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus
  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.
  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that
  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant
  improvement in the differential attack.

  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say
  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence
  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''

* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?

  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that
  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES
  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not
  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of
  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in
  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their
  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,
  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes
  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....
  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep
  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''
  
  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in
  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States
  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE
  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development
  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;
  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and
  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their
  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''

  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.
  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the
  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense
  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman
  presented above.

* Is DES available in software?

  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for
  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];
  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].
  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].

  FIPS 46-1 says ""The algorithm specified in this standard is to be
  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...
  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in
  compliance with this standard.""  Despite this, software
  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.

* Is DES available in hardware?

  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.
  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.

* Can DES be used to protect classified information?

  ""This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for
  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following
  conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and
  2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act
  of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.""

* What are ""ECB"", ""CBC"", ""CFB"", and ""OFB"" encryption?

  These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt 
  messages, files, and blocks of data, known as ""modes of operation.""
  Four ""modes of operation"" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2), 
  and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.   

  FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the
  unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.
  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.

  The four DES modes of operation are: 
	Electronic Code Book  (ECB), 
	Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), 
	K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and 
	K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).

  These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.

  Some symbols:

  P[n]	The n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from
  	decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.

  C[n]	The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to
  	decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.

  E(m)	The DES encryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using
  	the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key.

  D(m)	The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using
  	the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys
  	in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m).

  IV	A 64-bit ""initialization vector"", a secret value which, along with
  	the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor.

  I[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.
  R[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.

  LSB(m,k) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m.
  	e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1)

  MSB(m,k) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m.
  	e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1)

  = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage.


  Electronic Code Book (ECB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  C[n] = E(P[n])		P[n] = D(C[n])


  Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  C[0] = E(P[0]^IV)		P[0] = D(C[0])^IV
  (n>0)	  C[n] = E(P[n]^C[n-1])		P[n] = D(C[n])^C[n-1]


  k-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.  

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  	  Note that for k==64, this reduces to:

  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = C[n-1]			I[n] = C[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n])
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  CFB notes: Since I[n] depends only on the plain or cipher text from the
  previous operation, the E() function can be performed in parallel with
  the reception of the text with which it is used.


  k-bit Output FeedBack (OFB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.  

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  	  Note that for k==64, this reduces to:

  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = R[n-1]			I[n] = R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n])
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  OFB notes: encryption and decryption are identical.  Since I[n] is
  independent of P and C, the E() function can be performed in advance of
  the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used.

I believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country
without an export license. (Others will correct me if this is inaccurate.)

Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only way to
find out is to apply for a license.

Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to Canada if
YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send if you don't.

NOT an accurate analogy. David Koresh did not take a bunch of
hostages and then call the BATF with a ransom note. You make
it sound as if the BATF showed up to save those children in the
first place. I have some interesting news for youBATF
has absolutely NO jurisdiction in child abuse cases. 

It seems to me that the BATF showed up, took the Davidians hostage. 
Then the FBI showed up, negotiated to have a few of the hostages 
released, but were unable to keep the BATF from killing the rest 
of the poor people trapped inside the compound.

Agreed.  


It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just
as Marxism ""fails"" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to ""wither away,"" libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition.


This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case,
""limited"" and ""big"" government are not defined.  I would point out that
Lebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
with ""limited"" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western 
Europe (where ""people would rather live"") are often pointed out as 
nations with ""big government"" from a libertarian point of view.  

The argument is not between those who want ""limited"" government and those
who want ""unlimited"" government.  It is between those who believe
government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical 
grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.

	Remember me, Tom?  I hope you'll respond, and I seem to
be a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail,
so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to
make a few points here.


	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people
who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A
fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We
all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have
firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding
upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to
do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with
a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting
the many?  We say ""no,"" while others say ""yes.""


	Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.


	Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention
is how much one has to pay.


	It is this ""giving a little"" that makes Americans wary...
We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a
Chamberlain ""gave a little"" to a particular fascist/short asshole,
and how such ""appeasement"" worked.  While it might work in some
instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict
the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a
history of failure.


	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in
the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be
willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,
cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the
arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more
people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict
cars than it does guns.  How one defines ""essential"" often depends
upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we
look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.


	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As
Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even
when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did
with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first
acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show
that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.
Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown
or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.
One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.


	It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have
wound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that ""or"" was so logical.


	That was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out
how we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different
backgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on
how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.


	BATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  Child
abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities.


	That hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites.  Most people do
not get it for this reason, and I suspect money, not censorship, is the
main reason.  Do you get alt.sex* at your site?  I can't read it here
because of censorship and legal fears, so again our differences show.

You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z.
We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.
You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-
tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,
set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough
advertising.

I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories
I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since
xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to
X10).

The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you
provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.
Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 
do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
it's mapped.

As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export
is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.
But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say
whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.

As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else 
than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line
of code). I'll put this on export today.

SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE

    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM

    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,
    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version
    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)
    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE
    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly
    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or
    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming
    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.

    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news
    frequently.


    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?

    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).

    The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,

	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is
	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower
	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)
	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other
	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort
	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of
	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target
	in second stage.""

    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try
    to interpret.

    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.

    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the
	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line
	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly
	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of
	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z
	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""
	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the
	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.

    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more
	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or
	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").

    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver
	complexity"").

    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio
	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio
	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").

    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a
	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.

    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east
	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:
	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.
	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.

    This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
    achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers
    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main
    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime
    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is
    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""
    [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The
    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the
    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle
    guy.)

    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll
    maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw
    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total
    maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math
    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element
    array.


    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT

    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite
    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72
    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed
    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from
    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.
    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
    for these viewers.

    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.
    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.

    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is
    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press
    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle
    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying
    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions
    are not being covered.

                    LOW LEVELS OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES LINKED
                           TO SERIOUS ASTHMA ATTACKS
                           American Lung Association 

     A new study published by the American Lung Association has shown that 
surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with 
asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment.  
     The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits 
for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.  
The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed 
unsafe under federal air quality laws.  
     ""People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to 
exacerbate that inflammation,"" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  ""When people are on 
the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over 
the edge."" 
     The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits 
with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because 
they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of 
compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 
exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  
     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at 
levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 
microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with 
asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  
     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory 
Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung 
Association's medical section.  
     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that 
particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study 
by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles 
may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  
Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms 
and bronchitis in children.  
     ""Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,"" 
says Dr. Schwartz.  ""But more and more research is showing that particles are 
bad actors as well.""      One problem in setting, standards for particulate 
air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated 
pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex 
and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and

acid aerosols.  
     ""Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects 
of particulate air pollution,"" says Dr. Schwartz.  ""We have no way of 
duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  "" Consequently, most of what 
is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research 
like the Seattle study.  
     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur 
dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any 
time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with 
asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.
     ""In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only 
cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's 
rarely particulate matter,"" says Dr.  Schwartz.  ""However, PM10 doesn't have 
to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.""

               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in 
dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance 
techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care 
professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological 
characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, 
and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi 
and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in 
preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of 
presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel 
weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement. 
 
Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a 
distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; 
(2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential 
for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical 
excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and 
extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) 
patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high 
risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; 
(5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for 
melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education 
and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality 
from melanoma.

or by writing to:  Office of Medical Applications of Research, National 
Institutes of Health, Federal Building, Room 618, Bethesda, MD 20892.

                         NCI-Designated Cancer Centers

The Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers 
actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer 
incidence, morbidity, and mortality.  Within the program, there are four types 
of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily 
in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on 
clinical research; ""comprehensive"" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a 
multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community 
outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer 
prevention and control research. 
 
Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was 
the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new 
cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage 
of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened 
the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and 
cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew 
progressively. 
 
In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, 
there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria 
for comprehensive status. 
 
To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an 
institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly 
established in 1990, the eight criteria for ""comprehensiveness"" include the 
requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in 
several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong 
program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings 
into clinical practice. 
 
Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly 
beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also 
referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting 
the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass 
strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, 
significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important 
outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of 
sources. 
 
The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and 
capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit 
important new findings or address timely research questions. 
 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  
These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers 
engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators 
and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications 
from new discoveries in the laboratory. 
 
Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and 
clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently 
incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their 
overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. 
 
Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely 
structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and 
control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health 
departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention 
and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions 
responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  
Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with 
institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community 
hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. 
 
Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward 
creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through 
interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the 
laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

                 THE UCI MEDICAL EDUCATION SOFTWARE REPOSITORY 

This is to announce the establishment of an FTP site at the University of 
California, for the collection of shareware, public-domain software and other 
information relating to Medical Education.  

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse 
for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical 
education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with 
other users.  

To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to: 

                     FTP.UCI.EDU

The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope 
to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).  

Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you 
have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education 
efforts, either as an instructor or student.  

Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either 
the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the 
mode to binary and ""send"" or ""put"" your files.  Note that you won't be able to 
see the files with the ""ls"" or ""dir"" commands.  Please compress your files as 
appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something 
similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.  

After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for 
MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you 
have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.

Note that we can only accept software or information that has been designated 
as shareware, public-domain or that may otherwise be distributed freely.  
Please do not upload commercial software!  Doing so may jeopardize the 
existence of this FTP site.  

If you wish to upload software for other operating systems, please contact 
either Steve Clancy, M.L.S. or Albert Saisho, M.D. at the addresses above.

""NIH Set to Test Multiple AIDS Vaccines"" Reuters (04/08/93)  (Frank, 
Jacqueline) 

     Washington--The Clinton administration will permit the National  
Institutes of Health to test multiple AIDS vaccines instead of  only allowing 
the Army to test a single vaccine, administration  sources said Thursday.  The 
decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to 
test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of 
Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the 
therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies 
including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH 
that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is 
intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  
replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's 
reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the 
MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  
""The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the 
next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,"" said Shalala.   
Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine 
Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had 
convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested 
simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of 
multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two 
years.

""The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV"" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. 
114, No. 14, P. 18 

     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, 
the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the 
drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that 
although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk 
of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  
disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of 
the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the 
drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. 
researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, 
many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients 
experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  
AIDS symptoms.  In addition, researchers have long been familiar  with the

54832,"Hi,

In Canada, any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's a
small metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this is
that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the
National Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.

I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer
to Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with
nature on it's own terms."
67542,"I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What
is really powerful is that it can run the X server without
running a window manager. One can then run a special client
X program called a window manager, either (1) run 
motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network
traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook
from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).

This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager
(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.
(Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in
one manager and not the other).

Well the question is:

  On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to
  break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I
  want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run
  the window manager.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed ""Pro-Life"" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

I was at the Trenton Computer Fest and there were many sources of

yourself with inks that are available from the stationery store

the classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a
liberal/evangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight
evangelical view.  If you want to look at non-christian sources
try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while
blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.


This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of
related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter
went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the
technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)


When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class
about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights
that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your
faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example
friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the
wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God
willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to
decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology
is against God's revealed word.

I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout

same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has
been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for.

On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this
camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing

20605,"seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.) Watson) asks:
 > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?
 
       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. 
Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan
whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is ""what is
the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?""  When phrased
that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately
apparent what my objection to ""celebrating"" her would be.
 
 > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.
 
      No, you are thinking perhaps of ""Ressurection Sunday"" I think. 
(Though I'm not too crazy about the word ""Sunday"", but I certainly like
this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)
     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of
First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following
the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern
parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection
on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all
over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday
following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical
methods?
 
 > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate
 > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that
 > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?
 
      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore
goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that
whore out of the discussion.

       Yes, I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave
streets with ""Afro-Canadiantop"".  <grin> (I still think ""blacktop"" sounds
better though.)
 
 > As a short person, I hope they will also remove the definition

       Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are
both ""sinister"" and ""gauche"" so we probably will have some objections from
that quarter as well.

      Yes, that sounds much better to me.  Is there anyone out there would

      Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's ""slave""
returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon
Philemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different ""rules"" that
apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more ""male and female"" can Adam
and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are
differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in
Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.
 
---------------------------------------

[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it
seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is
new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.

I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this
argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of
the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some
Christians prefer to refer to ""first day"", ""second day"", etc.  However
the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question
seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows
as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when
they use it is different.

Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be
dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the
celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince
them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run
the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.
They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds
between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that
this is a healthy thing."

   version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.

I guess my question is: Is this a good deal? 
Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?

Thanks,

Carl Hoffman

The RS6000 compiler is so forgiving, I think that if you mixed COBOL & pascal
the C compiler still wouldn't complain. :-)

76781,"OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or
02106@brahms.udel.edu

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by
mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)

Why don't you cite the passages so that we can focus on some to discuss.
Then, following Jesus, you can make fools of us and our ""logic"".


Indeed, if you can justifiably make this assertion, you must be a
genius in logic and making fools of us should be that much easier."
58855,"     I am doing a term paper on steroids, actually the scientist who
helped crate the drug. I discovered that Joseph Fruton is one of the
researchers who helped create anabolic steroids. The only information on 
this person I know is he was a biochemist that did research in the 1930's.
I already did research at my local libraries, but I still need more
information. My instructor is requiring resources from the computer
networks. Please write back concerning my subject, any books, articles,
etc., will be appreciated.

	In response to a ""different"" kinda wallpaper, here's what I
use.  I think the original gif/whatever was called ""not_real"".  The 
artist name and logo is in the lower right corner.  You will need VGA
I think, and I have this sized for 800x600 256 color screens.  Use
this in your Windows directory and do not tile it.  Hope you enjoy.

66975,"From article <1993Apr17.010256.14372@eafs000.ca.boeing.com>, by ten0772@eafs000.ca.boeing.com (Timothy E. Neto):

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.

That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could
put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could
have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any
combination.

Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different
in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,
this is 12.

As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.
X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is
not the case.

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of
course, I could say ""Buy all you want, we'll support more.""

last 25 games.  Doesn't need to be accurate, a rough guess will do.  I'm

the playoffs.  Don't need to mention Pittsburgh.  They can't get any hotter

  I'm looking for X Servers for DOS or Windows.

  I've already seen Desqview/X and XVision but I'd like to be
 aware of other choices.

  Is there anything on the public domain or shareware ?

  And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive
 pricing ?

  What about incompatibilities ? Window managers ?

  Any info is welcome.



  Thanx in advance.

machines, the old data books are a goldmine of information you can

OW 3.0 is the same.  But, the definition of broken is relative.  Pageview

Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the ""bigotry"" is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

53614,"As per various threads on science and creationism, I've started dabbling into a
book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.  A question
that I had come from one of his comments.  He stated that God is not 
necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that
give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific 
fact.  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague. 
The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there 
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?

The VW ""Thing"" Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and 
possibly South America.  Good luck importing one--  They probably don't meet 
US safety and pollution requirements.  There are mechanics and junkyards 
which specialize in VW; they might be helpful for finding a ""Thing"" unless 
the WWII re-enacters have grabbed them all.

The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep, but was not 4-
wheel drive.  One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox, Kentucky, 
also the rare ""Schwimwagen"" (sp?) amphibious version, in full-scale dioramas.
Highly recommended!

84135,"Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)
want to find ""commandments"" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's
going on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more
open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is
the *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted ""at"" me often
enough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said
to have) said, ""If you love me, you will obey my commands.""  [John 14:15]

I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I
should do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,
but still under His direction, though we both call God ""Abba.""  Christians,
therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and
discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.
Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as ""slaves of
Christ"") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts
(whether classified as ""inspired"" or not) that are held up as models, in an
effort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges
from ""devotional"" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-
ical scripture as ""the Word of God.""  And at the highest pitch, this leads
to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that
can act as ""absolute"" guidance for our actions.

The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am
going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians
have looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not
because *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay
is Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the
witness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments
can we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard
question.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the
discussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike
*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason
and c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]

Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] ""I give you a new 
commandment: love one another.""  This is the ONLY place in the NT where
Christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting
on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we
*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus
says, ""Take this [bread]; this is my body.""  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,
Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),
and hence this, too, is a ""commandment.""

In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider
circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the
evangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or
entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment
from our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this
is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy
in which these words operate to ""bind"" Christians to the original command
to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.

I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that
it is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.
I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,
that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command
directed at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.
The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific
context of its statement to my own context as a ""disciple"" of Christ.

All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out
of the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts
-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native
languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without
*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original
languages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,
that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control
[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current
purposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already
coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world
than the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-
vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we
can read the texts as the original audience might have done.

Among the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*
commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that
one occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic ""Great Commandment"" is
that we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom
we congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, ""You have learnt
say to you: love your enemies.""  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted
does NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.
(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the ""love"" should extend to strangers
amongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,
goes on to have Jesus say. ""Even sinners love those who love them."" [6:27]
All of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the
scope of the ""new commandment"" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In
short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command
that is ""in force"" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other
Christians.

Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is
the case of the ""Great Commission"" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve
are sent out to evangelize, ""Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close
at hand.""  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather
specific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in ""Do not
turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town""
-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to
Jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians
than the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING
such an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference
is NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by
the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to
have felt obliged to ""proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand""
even (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to
the ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as
a ""commandment"" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I ""accept"" this?  I don't
know.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of
inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)
infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in
the gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this
kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*
have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable
length) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*
involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural
(though people will do their best to ""justify"" their assumptions by OTHER
references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)

Let's move on to the ""Great Commandment"" -- that we should love God with
our whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic
""equivalent"" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED
as a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with
the Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]

	""But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees
	they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,
	""Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?""

It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'
answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a
polemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer
in a far more positive light as (so the ""scribe"" in this version says)
""far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word
originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)
or sacrifice.""  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question
""to disconcert"" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains
[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one
could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this
said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on
Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each
case that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears
HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about
what WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on
our understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite
different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.

The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted
that ONLY in Luke do we get the ""fixing"" of this command by the parable of
the Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where
7:12 gives the ""Golden Rule"" as ""the meaning of the Law and the Prophets""
(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation
before Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely
reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not
*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of
inter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this ""intertextuality.""

My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ ""has"" to apply beyond the 
community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,
applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the
presentation not saying so explicitly) a ""commandment"" to Christians.
Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point
out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains
of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.

The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at
those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as 
commandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is 
pretty clear, ""The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty
of adultery against her.""  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew
has an escape clause [ ""except in the case of fornication"", 5:31 ]. This
seems to be a rather clear ""commandment"" (whether or not we take Matthew's
reservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,
at least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were
not explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the
things people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands
of Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists
of the synoptic tradition?

I'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this
is enough to start with.  The theme is: ""finding commandments in scripture
is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,
that is, our own cultural biases.""  I have, so far, identified a very few
""commandments"" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in
these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these
difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce
commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no
evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn
*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or
misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that
US law refuse to allow it, or refuse ""unrepentant divorcees"" places in
their churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into 
consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in
even the most ""liberal"" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal
Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has
recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a
""private"" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the ""public"" ceremony
he celebrated need not go through an agonizing ""examination"" by officials
who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands
we are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively
CREATED by a famous divorce! ]"
67390,"Hi there

(I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so I'm posting
here.)

I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720).
It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices
including digitiser tablets.  However, this digitiser makes use of the serial
port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.

The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from
devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).
I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input
device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?

What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a
specific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?
Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are
there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that
digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

See, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here.  Earlier, you said
that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive
behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply
human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious
of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.


I try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.

And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be
defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  However,
it seems silly to talk of a ""moral"" planet because it obeys the laws of
phyics.  It is less silly to talk about animals, as they have at least
some free will."

It was not just those penalties. Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't

And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want
to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his
InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually
every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the
driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the
WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to
how cards stack up on real world tasks.

In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators,
and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly,
they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt
operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other
types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least
one card was eliminated from the ""Editor's Choice"" because of
cheating on the benchmark."

"
75961,"I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were
not addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned
by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is 
often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs.
In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied
Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is 
disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed 
solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.
It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem
on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,
and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.
I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of
what the situation really is in South Lebanon.



I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information
we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the 
people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily
business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are
older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to
imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like 
to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....
SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are
supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they
are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where
an 8 year old girl just happened to be.
We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is 
the Israeli way of telling us that ""if you're gonna hurt our soldiers
you're gonna pay the price"".  We accept this as a price we have to pay
to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting
the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather
just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young 
men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are
taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.
Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance
on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING 
ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real 
leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.
The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a 
regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that
the so called ""Security Zone"" is necessary for the protection of 
Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,
than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the 
establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect
our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the
best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the
establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.

I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only
real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace
settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and
peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure
no one on either side of the border is shelled.
This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to
realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more
Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
would have resulted in.  
If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw 
unilaterally from the so-called ""Security Zone"" before the conclusion
of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,
advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's 
public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations 
since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in 
peace and has already offered some important concessions.
Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah
be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not 
accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone
and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.
There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such 
circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
in all other parts of Lebanon.
  

I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

 I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make

Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.
The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave
Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an 
occupying soldier is attacked.

	It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.
	One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself
	against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)
	made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.

		I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know
		that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.

		It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such
		comments in advance of forensic pathology.

	Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.  


	Yah.


	BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:
	a)	No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.
	b)	Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?
	c)	.... ah God:

			25 children
			at least 64 adults
			plus 6 at the beginning
			and more BATF agents

			all dead.


	Has anyone asked themselves these questions:

	1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the
	  opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:
		a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting
		  part comes out.
		b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do
		  not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?
	2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission
	  video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?

		a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?
			That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are
			twounits on the professional handhelds (so no
			tape turnover gaps)?
		b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point
			fingers in either direction.

	As you well point out, Stephen.


	More on this below.


	Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full
	pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.


	More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended
	that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --
		a contradiction in terms.


	True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out
	from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.


	This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note
	that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today
	is one where the Government:

		wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.


	Yes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.
	ANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves
	the coin.



	Yah.  Fewpeople hear the contradiction:

		Money
		made
		in the image
		of God


	I wish you were wrong.  Many pundits are saying 3 years.
	The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my
	exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney
	is:

		I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.


	25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF
	helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.

		The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely
		straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences
		havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that
		Koresh or his followers caused this.

		The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations
		and morals (""not my fault, Koresh did it!"") than they
		are with:

			25 dead children.

	Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.


	More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).

	Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever
	token of objective law and justice a society has had,

		Hitlerrs have followed.


	You do your name sake proud, Stephen.
	Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:
		each voice in the wilderness now will
		save a generation unborn from horror


	The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this
	society is the day that society is already beyond redemption

		and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian
		belief aytall.

	... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the
	act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the
	wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or
	punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to
	be a human society, and become a society of animals.

		We are _very_ cclose to that.


	Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be
	patient.

For those who like contrary questions:

	NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law
	official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.
	The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the
	equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake
	of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:

		innocent until proven guilty.
	not
		innocent until presumed guilty.

	1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.

		Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard
		equipment.

	2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?

		a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This
		  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable
		  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.

			.... gotcha!

		  ... when in isolation from other substances.

		  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote
		  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce ""this window,
		  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come
		  down"", and maintain a left to right sequence?

		b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when
		  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)
		  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to
		  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long
		  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend
		  to ignite.

			What other chemicals come up in the forensics?
			Who else will be allowed to test the site?

		c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation
		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made
		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature
		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain
		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length
		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).

			Check your military records; look at the tapes.
			Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),
			tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why
			the hurry. was there still a comm channel open
			to the outside?).

			Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the
			compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones
			are missing?

	Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.
	You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?
		IN advance of a Court?  God help us.
			(For we are surely not helping ourselves).
	You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?

		You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.
		Look again.

	Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.
		AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.
	But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance
		to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.

No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.

	Listen to your hearts, people.

Thanx again Stephen.

is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some
interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more
if there is interest.

Yankess (to the tune of ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"")

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of ""Like a Rolling Stone"")

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said ""Beware Cone, he's bound to roam""
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of ""Highway 61"")

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of ""The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter"")

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He sits in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have been the Tampian of the world!

I use Arts & Letters on a PC and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences
it traces beautifully. BUT - there's a trick to tracing. I've traced entire
cartoon images into custom clip art, but you can't expect to just point to
the image and get it just like that, it takes a little work (in some cases
a lot of work). You need to trace a drawing piece by piece, and then put it

53607,"We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. We
would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between
firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same
direction. 

To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C
5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that
corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line
of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;
we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the
time the init line of sonar B is activated. 

We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.
We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
for sonars B and C. 

Has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and
this type of experience? Your suggestions for remedies will be greatly
appreciated.

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

Commercial:

  Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price
  is about $100. Their address is:
	VRL
	2341 Ganador court
	San Luis Obispo,
	CA 93401
	Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515

  Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.
  Check with:
	Natural Graphics
	P.O. Box 1963
	Raklin, CA 95677
	Phone (916) 624-1436

  Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:
   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics
   1600 Indiana Ave.
   Winter Park, FL 32789
   Phone: (407) 384-9484
   FAX: (407) 647-7242

b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

c. Others:

========================================================================

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

SCRY
----
[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a ""Brick of Bytes"", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level
  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send
  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,
  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass
  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send
  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

MAP II
------
  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.

CLRview
-------
  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit
  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.

  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the
  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports
  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,
  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) 
  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

End of Resource Listing"
51673,"Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This
is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the
stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI 
accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,
New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.

I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive
tower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto
which I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally
terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems
occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two
internal hard drives."
15525,"One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration
body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is
essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil
liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get
involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good
reason.

When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the
auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a
security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always
figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix
the problem.

Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.
Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a
bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The
auditee can say, ""Well, you told us this way would be OK.""  It
compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's
job.

Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.
Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets
away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil
liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.
But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant
and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.

There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one
place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed
automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum
was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and
was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.

I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration
situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll
checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again
today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can
be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are
legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could
put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU
conflict of interest.

As always, my opinions are my own."

Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.
(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)


The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and 
expansion Senators finished tied for last. 
The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last).
The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last).
The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago 
team around is a `good thing'


This may be an appropriate comparison.
The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing 
18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. 
In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only
7, 7 and 3 games out).
Even great teams can lose - That's why they play the season.

On the basis of these examples I would say that Joe Moore was only wrong
in claiming Augustine as a prime mover of the sin=sex view.  These quotes
clearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance, even within
the marriage relationship (else they would not apply to Mary after her marriage
to Joseph).

So Joe's assignment of the reasoning behind the concept of the perpetual
virginity of Mary does seem to be supported by these quotes.

Yes, as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless.  This is true in
exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in
Zeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies
from many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same
way as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.
Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians
base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.

The ""weak atheist"" position is logically extremely assailable -- any
logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it
as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak
atheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with
attempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail
miserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the
""strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist"" position do so on this
basis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments
presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;
therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do
not exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are
defined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of
popular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite
questionable. "

That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small
sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so
the salespeople wouldn't give her the ""bimbo"" treatment.
Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan
Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what ""we""
wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid
kept playing the ""let me run this price by the sales manager"".  After
playing the ""good salesman, bad salesman"" game, we finally told him
that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps
we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in
the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick
in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's ""Don't Get Taken Every Time"" for a
list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of ""you'll have to
work with us on this price"", also known as ""each time you come up a
thousand dollars we'll come down ten"", the salesmanager gave a signal to
his two sales cronies, stood up, and said ""well, we can't come down any
more so I guess we can't help you"" and they trouped out of the room,
leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.
I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they
can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and
I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering
why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the
door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on
the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,
and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few
sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line
(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call
another dealership from ""his"" phone!  I said that since he'd announced
that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried
to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our
voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,
anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.
Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he
begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,
we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.

Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out
the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,
customers and all, ""Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!""
So my friend bought a Sentra."
15202,"Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that
the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only
used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file
encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced
standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to
easy-to-break inverters.

Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.
Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
e-mail and files, let's focus on this.

One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.

Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal
less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no
secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a ""goat"" can
eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and
cordless phones.

-------

Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure
without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses
confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese
security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make
available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.

Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to
have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of
depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable
escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the
week, and that system has worked pretty well.

From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that
need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in
return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES
and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly
skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be
checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to
be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys
pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate
communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to
eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.

noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue,

15644,"As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington
Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company
is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end
of this message on how to contact them).

   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that
we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications
brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.

   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the
rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:

 - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use
   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.

 - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone
   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.
   This stuck them as strange, until now...


   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several
concerns over the new Clipper Chip:

  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.

  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto
    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency
    of the government.

  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm
    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.

  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that
    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or
    changing the keys themselves.

  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and
    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed
    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very
    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique
    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is
    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.

Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell
me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.
However he told me a little:

 - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been
   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is
   secure.

 - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.
   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret
   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate
   the following:

    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but
      Mr. Melnick stated ""Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out."")

    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.

    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).

    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that
      it is _adujustable_ and is ""More than adequate for security.""

    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and
      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which
      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I
      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.

    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques
      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the
      hardware chip.

    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars
      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced
      enough, which probably won't happen]).

    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm
      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted
      data into ""blocks."" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know
      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported
      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.

    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!



Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out
of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in
stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact
them, they can be reached at..

The reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious. You have used the terms
absolute, objective and others interchangeably. Same with moral values, values,
at all, worth, measuers, and usefulness. You infer from them as if they were
the same.
 
To the IF. When the If is not fulfilled, your intermission is a waste of time.
Assuming that you don't intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you
want to argue a point.
 
You have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested
observer. There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for
objective and morality being a contradiction.
 
 
 
Fine. And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. I could
name quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (Not that that wasn't

claims with.
 
 
 
Clutching a straw. I don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were
loaded terms are fixpoints. Those who deny the morality of freedom make quite
clear what they say, their practice is telling. Yes, there are even those who
are willingly unfree. It is quite common in religions, by the way. For one,
there is a religion which is named Submission.

it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
on how they perform.


Not to this degree.


Why?


Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has
the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle
isn't reusable, it's salvagable).


The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X
shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.


The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available
thrust and still land safely.


Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same
thing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.


You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You
wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
harmful side effects would you?


You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it
will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do
need to do to build SSTO.


Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.


Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will
carry passengers.


I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original
schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.


Your ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being
unreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for
opponents of manned space to kill it.


The only way to prove those things is to build it.

quite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000
feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...

Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very
dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep
away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.

Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there
(no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible?
Is there something else that I could do?

59554,"I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to 
posting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to 
delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send 
it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.
Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all 
day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has 
them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and 
Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to 
point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical 
community.

Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long 
time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've 
already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.
Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in 
the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).

When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as 
the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have 
decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C
(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is 
also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).
The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if 
vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in 
both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).

Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and 
beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene 
is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-
carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present
(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other 
tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human 
adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We 
are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about 
30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they 
were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that 
of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is 
not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient 
reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.

The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of 
vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet 
surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A
(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National 
Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the 
RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 
7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was 
killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main 
reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient 
reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to 
move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move 
towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have 
some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely 
important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that 
battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 
1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the 
dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 
1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill 
the reserves).

We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a 
normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient 
reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.
But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how 
much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has 
overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol 
level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your 
liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal 
range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is 
diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation 
of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level 
of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to 
vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative 
approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in 
this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty 
of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, 
redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).

I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they 
had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear 
signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient 
needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you 
will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for 
PMS studies).

Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will 
never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to 
retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the 
liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But 
taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to 
fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% 
that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One 
other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not 
convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the 
enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of 
retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will 
cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.

Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body 
uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be 
nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde
(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the 
retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses 
retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells 
and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, 
one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the 
title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play 
a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role 
is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake 
of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But 
retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once 
it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC 
group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.

Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are 
helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and 
they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do 
themselves more harm than good.

Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.
In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus 
production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from 
entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the ""first 
line"" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown 
to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which 
stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration 
and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters 
are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not 
normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.
This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials 
in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.

Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that 
vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who 
walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be 
worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already 
has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my 
course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic 
medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.

Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night 
vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The 
serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver 
reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have 
trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled 
out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels 
were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 
20ug/dl.

As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of 
the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably 
see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low 
serum retinol levels.

What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts
from their book:

Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for 
growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for 
reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie 
malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and 
metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, 
which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not 
in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A 
status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal 
range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are 
indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater 
than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation 
tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to 
perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to 
vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The 
bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal 
tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than 
7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts 
over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, 
erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois
(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  

They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A 
deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol 
level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in 
adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule 
out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical 
lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give 
them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity 
should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the 
patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.

Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.
Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.
I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to 
fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the 
serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the 
vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a 
demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will 
provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status 
are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more 
agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But 
vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could 
become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human 
fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 
18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on 
the human fetus.

Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes 
but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use 
retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it 
full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to 
prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup 
jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A 
supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I 
think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market 
but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general 
public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation."

67527,"I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using

Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been
made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of
Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of
his supporters.


See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez
to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward
to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember
being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was
only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?
Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was
there.  Sure, I say go for it.

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/
Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.

BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.






Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,
let's compare our decision to one of the most ""Boneshead"", right?

Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't
make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess
Mieske has a future.)

(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)

This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior
to us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced
and therefore ""more intelegent"" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there
is life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have
no clue as to weather they are ""intelegent"" or not.


That's a good point, I hadn't thought of it that way.  My question however was
more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars
and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign
countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night.
Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved
these issues on our own?


But... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided
that certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior
to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no
homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and
more.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm
the land and go to church on sunday?

Hmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close
to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so
much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.
Why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business
application. 

What do you mean by 'no ""retail price""'.  Quite the contrary, I think.
The price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,
IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling
required.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One
price, medium performance, ready to go.

When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears
(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and
Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who
sells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I
suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know
didly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any
of the  Apple dealers I spoke with...

If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from
Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.
I'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple

If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky.
Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? 
Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, 
drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well,
anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the 
Nazis.

 ""Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously
  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,
  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and

As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) 
was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in
Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but 
had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally
Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect
of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian
who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.
In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central
Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the 
American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local
Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20
chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters
and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.
Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:

 ""The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.
  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.""[1]

Now wait, there is more.

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about
600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.

The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000
dead.

The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a
15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali
Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the
bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr
Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead.""

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old
lawyer said at his small office.

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 1990.

Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70
miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.

Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage
of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours.""

Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's
report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six
policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the
names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The
most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27
February.

""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream
and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot.

""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and
one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return.""

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces.

wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment
has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist
worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.

This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid
destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who
are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the
Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre,
or the focus of culture (hence ""humanism""). This consciousness was
also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the
present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the
same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.
This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it
began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European
society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later
stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that
justified
 them.

There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of ""economics"" -
from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of
creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces
and powers. There were denominational differences among the new
worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was ""the free
rein of the market mechanism"", while for others it was ""the
dialectical forces of history"". But in both the capitalist West and
the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of
Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who
were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to
oppose what was happening and state their case.

61149,"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can
be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at
mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.

Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on the
outside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback with
integrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from file
geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much
of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The
white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte
Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)
pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting
can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass
properties of the Station change during assembly.

The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because
it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong
part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are
limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the
docking system.

The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional
launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit
(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never
had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to
(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual
de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the
residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from
impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a
Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating
the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing
further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,
it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the
nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.

The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment
Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used
for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system
which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a
controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we
did with Skylab).

The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be
used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity
on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device
for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on
one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.

This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,
data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work
done to date.

Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,
and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors
I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
seems more likely.

Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;
you should see his notes in the GIF files.  

Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for
anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll

Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. 

As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was
a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They
said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low 
numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked
great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! 
It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  
I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those 
who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  
( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should
be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about 
the transmission and taking my chances.

I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the

Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three
that come to mind are as follows:

1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear.
2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some 
   interesting conversation.
3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out

20937,"I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,
     and the trumpet had blown.
I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment
     before the white throne.
Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate.
They cried for the rock and the mountains.
They prayed, but their prayers were too late.
The soul that had put off salvation, 
""Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.
 No time now to think of ....... religion,"" 
Alas, he had found time to die.
And I saw a Great White Throne.

Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for
motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said, 
""Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.""

Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of
it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that
there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  

As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit
people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a
place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to
experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we
can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going
to ""outer darkness."".  

Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared
it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,
that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the
elect are the ""whosoever will"" and the nonelect are the ""whosoever wont's."" 
Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its
practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, ""Ye would not.""  

Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be
Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, ""I don't believe in hell.  I
believe in the religion of Jesus.""  But did you know that Jesus talked more
about hell than He did about heaven!  ""Oh I believe in the religion of the
sermon on the mount.""  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the
mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. 
Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over
in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. 
Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. 
The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't
want to see them go there.

Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,
not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, ""where the worm never dies, and
where the fire never goes out.""  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell
a ""furnace of fire.""  It was Jesus that used the word, ""condemnation.""  ""And
this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because
their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  

How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?
 Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. 
When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, ""outer
darkness.""  

Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over
here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are
prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a
party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it ""outer darkness.""  ""Outer""
-away from God.  ""Darkness"" -God is light.  

No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated
Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my
son would say, an ""awesome"" thought.  

""My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?""  Hell is isolation.  There's no
fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace
in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in
hell.  

""I thirst.""  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving
with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it
eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will
crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way
and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of
environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  

In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life
ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the
illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking
to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved
and he was commenting about it to Jack.  ""They sing these songs and read Bible
verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think
God would send me to hell?""  Jack answered by saying, ""Yes I think he would!"" 
Of course the barber said, ""What do you mean by that.""  ""Well if you can't
stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to
God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd
be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what
you really are.""   It makes a man think.

The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal
existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask
me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He
died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He
purchased eternal life for the ""whosoever wills.""  He suffered eternal
judgment.  

A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying ""Everybody is going
to be saved eventually.""  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate
them.  The sheep from the goats.  "".After you die there's a probationary period
in which God prepares you for heaven.""  No, my Bible says that ""It is appointed
unto men once to die and then comes judgment.""  Some of the cultist believe in
annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished
out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as
there is in heaven.  

I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy
listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a
place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any
hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found
it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a
God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of
creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed
us in a ""uni""verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is
such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us
from hell leads us to two applications.

1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. 
Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just
around the bend the bridge is out.  ""Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we
persuade men.""

2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful
chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if
you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die
and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and
suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like
Dirty Harry said, ""You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do
you?""  ""A man's got to know his limitations.""  Don't be one of the ""whosoever
wont's.""  "
59033,"The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to:
1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might
   have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with
   it or actually having this disorder ) and
2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours
after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston
and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.
This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in
learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with
hospitals, procedures...etc.

I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed 
quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight
as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs
and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal,
but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests,
body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not
know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot
of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where
we stand right now...."

59430,"Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the
following two health problems:

First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a
Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it,
the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally
have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki
ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,
if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,
food occasionally gets ""stuck"" before reaching my stomach. This results
in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.
Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,
and causes frequent discomfort.

My doctor wants to ""dilate"" the ring using the
following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach
for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing
some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know
if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,
was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on
safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become
a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding
procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,
especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,
reaction to anesthesia).

The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number
of ""extra"" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there
has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24
hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,
however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist
indicated that such a number was ""normal"". It certainly doesn't
feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of
extended ""runs"" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause
severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good
health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or
caffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as ""normal"", but don't
want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number
of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something
as simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying
down for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly
be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the
same time.

Thanks for any help/advice!

Oh, probably.

Ms. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for
1983 and 1992.  (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows?
She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)  Those
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being
scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*.  Something is
being done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games
by 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches.  Given the increasing
specialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me.

If it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  Then
I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher
after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules,
which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).

The problem is, who decides whether that time is ""wasted?""  You don't seem
to think it is at all.  Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one
case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the
difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows?  If the
rules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my
mind.  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing,
or else nothing will be changed.

This thread began on SCA, when he and another guy claimed both Stalin

Lenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity.

To counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who, during his youth,

to be a priest, but not for what religion!"" (BTW, Stalin developed
strong antisemitic feelings later in his life).

178564,"From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:

    Male sex survey: Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough
    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional
    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are."

Dear Marc,

a style that raises the level of posts on this board.  If you just don't seem
to get it, I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities
than of him.  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions 
well.
	Having said this, I would like to ask in general for people on this 
board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack
the author of the posts.  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the

54853,"OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you
know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.
You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed
individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family
against this attack b) realize ""oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I 
better surrender"" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do
what they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you 
defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your
door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to 
charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that
you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological 
warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up
and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still
holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using
tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that
you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest
round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as
cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through
the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created
by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it.

I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with
the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to 
surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency
committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted
search warrant.  

Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements
regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered
trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire
which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now 
playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of 
Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses
by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been
held off in their assault.

I don't believe I ever said that morality was all relative.

What I said was that I can make my mind up on my own, thank you, and that 
you don't have the right to tell others what to think.

I think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is 
a respect for human life and the dignity of the person.  It is all the

Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing
Corporation is planning a special volume on ""Shape Analysis"", scheduled
for this year.

This volume will be a part of ""Progress in Neural Networks,"" an annual
book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and
application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to
present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on
this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.

Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling,
shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching,
surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing
neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated
non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably,
but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. Please send
electronically (if you prefer, you can send a hardcopy to the address below)
an  abstract and an outline to
msuk@ima.enst.fr
by May 30, 1993. The full paper must be submitted by July 31, 1993 to:

Maybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the
case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and
also prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would 
cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of 
Christ.

Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the
time they were made.  ""Out of Egypt have I called my Son"" refers both
to Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   ""Why do the heathen rage""
was said of David and also of Christ.  

Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, ""and his bishoprick
let another take.""  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His
disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, ""the children thou
hast given me.""

How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.

Actually, Jerry Brown essentially did...and Clinton, in his demagogue

Why don't the Republicans get their act together, and say they
will support a broad-based VAT that would have to be visible
(the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe)
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform, and
force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax
rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
be increased only via a national referendum.

Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile...
shift the tax burden from investment to consumption, and get

Since your criminal grandparents ruthlessly exterminated more than
600,000 Kurds between 1914 and 1916 in Eastern Anatolia. Referring to 
notes from the personal diary of Russian General L. Odishe Liyetze on 
the Turkish front, he wrote,

""On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers 
 bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding
 Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most
 likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish 
 Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed
 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization.""

On March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official
Russian account of the Turkish genocide),

""Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos,
 dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants...
 alas! mainly of women and children.""

        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander
        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,
        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)

""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the
 liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the
 allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of
 the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian
 was permitted to approach the city and its environs.

 While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained
 in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the
 area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to 
 attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the
 plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
 of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by
 the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers
 who had remained in the rear during the war.

 One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of
 soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
 seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,
 and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud
 and dirt...

 It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
 traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
 and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night
 patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The 
 Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
 also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the
 trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for
 fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder
 and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.

 Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir
 Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander
 in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.
 The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals
 that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its
 highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
 of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.

 ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,
 Odishelidge. They were as follows:

 The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the
 act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...
 More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been
 killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless 
 Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the
 murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood 
 near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:
 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten
 more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when
 the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.

 The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
 fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.
 Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw
 towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew
 to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and
 destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.

 During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages
 that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the 
 Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers
 were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time
 when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
 the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries
 of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the 
 Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would
 have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from
 acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
 hatred and loathing.

 Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that
 he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The
 Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the
 stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since
 the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed
 in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen
 of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping
 him with the iron heel of his boot.

 Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape
 from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off
 by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
 children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village
 of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:

 There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.
 Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and
 spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about
 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 
 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,
 children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of
 rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.

 A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators
 for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov
 to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be 
 proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's
 disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,
 instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely
 reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told
 the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more
 licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent
 and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
 and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,
 the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
 claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.

 An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command
 narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:

 The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut
 out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.
 The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men 
 of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they
 took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people
 among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
 my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were 
 released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. 
 Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
 Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered
 on the streets.

 On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent
 Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
 threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for
 murdering an innocent Turk. 

 When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would 
 be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare
 you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the 
 Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard
 that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within
 the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same 
 day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to
 him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
 act. However no result was achieved.

 In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a
 natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived
 the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the 
 Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had
 been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. 
 The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
 one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached
 three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details
 of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers
 were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
 withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
 people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading
 Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.
 However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
 the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower
 classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders
 of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. 

 I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals
 were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who
 opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that
 it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.
 Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian
 cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have
 supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred
 to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by
 the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.
 You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a
 conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
 of the Turkish soldiers.

 The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real
 nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can
 be undone.""

Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the
biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the
modern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That
Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no
reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of
resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what
the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work 
_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ
Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul
here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there
is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,
no ascension either.

Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the
grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts
until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up
with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,
I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts
before this which mention the tomb). 
    


You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the
foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.
See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_."

I'm not 100% sure, but I think the T800 was a 25MHz transputer?  so ya tie
a gazillion of them together to get 100mips.  (The newest is the T9000
which kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though).

Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced
RISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the
same ""performance"" as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the
weird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the
Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*).
and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and
make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though
you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).

If you can make a ""CISC"" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)
with the ideas behind the ""RISC"" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then
I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC...

If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively
speaking).

Now I may sound like I like intel, but I'll have to say that the P5 is some
real kick butt pile of Si and SiO2...

But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line... or I'm gonna
start crying...

I've never seen a game where one player has committed 5
penalties.  Something like this would require more attention by
the referee.


But you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
have been one before.  I can see the relationship between free
throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's
obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more
opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's
at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is
probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with.

Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA
game you attended was, that play was stopped too often.
Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a
hockey game?"

Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays
really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths
is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he
allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you
should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third
period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they
would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular
goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they
are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like
Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there 
are any legitimate excuses. 


I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a
relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result 
in a goal. 


In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as
'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty
either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal
only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second 
goal.


What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the 
game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you
could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what
if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final
result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and
email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive
screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie
is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is
focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*
goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.



WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally
unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if
you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key
saves at the key times.


For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in
the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.

                            
I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think
the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've
made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective
(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.

Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.
What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent
increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit 
(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.
Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps
growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each
president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.
Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.

As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....

During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an
""economist"" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his
arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know
with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government
policy, particularly ""supply side"" policy, since taxes do not ""cause"" 
economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be 
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and 
create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is."

There are several products you might investigate.  If you've got
$20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good
choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar
architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact
information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't
be too hard to find.

If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook
(hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language
which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting,
but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.

You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing
direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release
available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in
functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs
$495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.

59606,"I posted about a ""pulse of (relaxation) electricity"".  I now think
it more like a pulse of ""relaxation"" or comfort than a pulse of
electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling
of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.

     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your
palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you
relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So,
you feel a ""shiver"" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).
Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you
hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down
in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This
roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your
body.

     ""Shiver"" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake.
What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body
experience?"

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the
Baycom and my PMP modems)?  Ideally, something that is geared toward 
hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the
hundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).

I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.
Any suggestions?

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.
With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while disk
operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.

So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it
possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes, with no DMA."

Christians.


When was the last time you heard about a Jewish animal sacrifice?


The blood sacrifice of an innocent man?


Then why don't Christians follow it, why don't they even follow their
own Ten Commandments?


So, in short; Hitler is in heaven and Gandhi is in Hell?

                         ^^^^^^^ Militia

                  ^^^^^ State

        ^^^^ Arms

You didn't even get the capitalization correct!  Try reading USCA on
the Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of the
Constitution. 


Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of
    being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost
    every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to
    which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers
    are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of
    ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government
    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military
    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are
    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments
    are afraid to trust the people with arms.""
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right
    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A
    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free
    country...""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of
    the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with
    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it
    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
    a year.""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing
    armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the
    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be
    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large
    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****
    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.""
    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they
said ""people"", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to ""the Right
of the Militia""?...  ;-)


You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and
probably females under current interpretation). 


The Amendment does nor refer to ""well organized"", it says ""well
regulated"".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check
how _well regulated_ I am. 



Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that
was to insure the People could form a ""well regulated Militia"", not a
""well organized militia"".


What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can set
h_bar = C = 1...


Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist
Papers?! 

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General
    Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first
    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
    recital of particulars.""

But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He
only wrote it.


That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist
Papers. 


Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says ""well organized
militia"". 


That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any*
weapon currently in use in the armed forces.


But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.


    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This
    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit
    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,
    they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or
    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.""

    Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate
    over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August
    1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the
    establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...
    Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of
    the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order
    to raise an army upon their ruins.""

So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
our Liberties and Rights.

anyone is interested in reading the truth about this matter please

68325,"I am working for a company which has only one connection to the Internet.
This is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). I would like to be
able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the DISPLAY to my PC
which is running an X-terminal emulator (eXceed/W). The display can be set
to the gateway workstation with no problem but when I set the variable to 
my IP address I get a ""Error: Can't open display"" message. 

This can't be that hard to work around can it?

BTW I have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company)

That is the standard advice in dermatology texts.
The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  Don't bother unless
it doesn't work otherwise.


Exactly, but it adds to the ""ritual"" aspect, which is important for
us suggestible patients.  (Posters, don't bother to repeat the 
rationale for the soak.)


Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is 
famous for that.  One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin
cream is, the more effective.  


Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP
lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more
expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As I've commented before, petrolatum
is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in
biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close,
even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there
for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  Don't panic, but
also don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin.

Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least,
by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure
on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem
as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).
There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop
should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.

I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player 
at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a 
while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the 
amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  
I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

You said ""a nice Alpine"" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher

you scrap it, since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair.

Praise the Lord that we are all members of the same body.  Let us agree to

21523,"

I quote from the journal, ""30 Days In the Church and In the World,""
1992, No. 8/9, p. 29. 

Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism:

	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise
	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot
	cause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of 
	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties,
	including the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similar
	reasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede
	aggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Church's 
	traditional teaching has always been expressed and will 
	continue to be expressed in the 
	consideration of the real conditions of common good and the
	effective means for preserving public order and personal
	safety.  To the degree that means other than the death
	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the
	peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred
	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the
	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.  

As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capital
punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total
accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly
force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.  


I seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His
instrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question
of faith or morals arises.

21350,"Michael Bushnell writes;


Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use
of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it
said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that
has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the
Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not.
	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene
Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the
Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.
	I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in
ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East
emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father
through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the
Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see
below)

	""Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do
call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the
root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the
river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,
but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must
necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on
that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there
are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is
third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit
of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,
and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.""
	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)

and

	""I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father
through the Son""
	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)

And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,
Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of
generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession
emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in
a more preeminent way.

	""For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it
from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the
Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called
unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of
theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a
matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy
Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives
to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit
proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of
the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound
mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,
however, but proceeds from each and both.""
	-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)

So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at
least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but
in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the
procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the
Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,
the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any
mention of the Son being necessary.
	In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope
St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.
Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose
of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the
Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic
position, which I enunciated above.
	As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I
will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke
of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone ""to produce,
write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by
the Fathers of Nicea.""  That Creed is a different Creed than that of
Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of
course in that they were condemning the adoption of the
Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of
Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,
who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the
Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy
Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan
Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council
Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy
Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been
against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves
approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations
of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work
done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows
that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed
by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians
in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until
many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was
not disputed, I provide more quotes below.

	""Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to
God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly
clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding
from it.""
	-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial
Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)

	""The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he
is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone
loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it
is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he
is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the
Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,
that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall
receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'""
	-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)

	""The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the
appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to
the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the
Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will
receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the
Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit
divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of
the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like
soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father
and of the Son, a third by appelation....
	""The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit
breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor
is the Spirit created.""
	-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,
8 and 75 (374 AD)

	""Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is
it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,
it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to
speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the
Son, His Sources.""
	-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)

	Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,
Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,
all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine
expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church
that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus
who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is
not enough to bring up the ""proceeds from the Father"" line of the Creed
or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does
not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does
proceed from the Father."

HELSINKI WATCH: ""PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE""

Ankara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the ""Helsinki Watch""  it is
stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced
with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being
implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government
should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of
minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and
in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the ""Turkish
Minority"" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify
themselves as 'Turks'.

NEWSPOT, May 1992


GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS

The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek
state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish
minority with Turkey.

Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is
called ""Greek""  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the
minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with
Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western
Trace are also Turkish.""

Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in
Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement
signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey
in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.

Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.
SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,
Faikoglu said.  ""In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented
Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European
countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal
rights.""

On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are
predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical
reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign
powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by
cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was
will to improve relations with Greece.

NEWSPOT, January 1993


MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.

Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in
Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a
Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.

  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)
have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in
an Athenian magazine.

  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly
magazine  ""ENA""  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as
Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would
field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek
general election.

  Bulev said in the interview: ""I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.""
Sideropoulos said  in the  article that ""Greece  should recognise
Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations
against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the
border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC
are falling.""

  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court
summons,  was   that  ""they  have   spread...intentionally  false
information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the
citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the
international interests of the country (Greece).""

  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a
Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to
1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely
concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state
if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.

  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned
Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian
villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in
1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5
million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000
in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.

  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian
human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a
few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in
the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced
the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of
Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the
majority of ethnic Macedonians live.

  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in
which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,
especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its
northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.

  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned
Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who
largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the
US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections
are over.

As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The
proposal clearly states:

=> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
=> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
=> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David.
Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.


That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to
think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost
anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean
secure) encryption is used. What will happen when (""if""? Ha!
optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT
SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of
these ""some"" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes
on the former (""almost nobody"") - which is clearly an improvement -
and ""forgets"" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (""guaranteed"").
Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the
strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.


It's not just ""continued ability"". It's -guaranteed- ability.


Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's
take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't
think about the future. Trust us.


It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the
intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.


Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will
allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure,
of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the
jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The
new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell,
that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that
mentally pervert...


Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm)
has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any
details whatsoever and has concluded that it is ""highly secure"". I
guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the
two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government
can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto
experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David
Sternlight has already done all the job for them...


""Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you.""


""Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of
future safety, do not deserve either."" This (or something like that; I
don't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said
by one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more
carefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.


The main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure
cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying ""we
guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use
any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as
just a default, voluntary implementation"", there would have been much
less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise
you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?


No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.


While the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is
not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily
breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable
by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who
has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't
you simply trust them, huh?


It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It
might be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a
wild speculation.


The trapdoors -are- there. In government's hands. The keys.


Legitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I
guess, it's the government, right? The guys who already have the keys?
It's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide
who has the right to use it ""legitimately""...


Impossible, since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence
and ignorance as in the provious threads.


Unfortunately, I have yet to see you posting a technically competent

21310,"Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:

1) ""I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and
between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush
your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.""
    -Genesis 3.15

2) ""He who commits sin is of the devil ...""
    -1 John 3.8

3) ""Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...""
    -Luke 1.28

   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.
   First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the
first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of
Satan. ""[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in
the truth because there is no truth in him."" John 8.44.  Now the
proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and ""the
woman"", and enmity between Satan and ""her seed.""  Now the woman is both
Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. 
""Her seed"" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the
same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as
we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that
Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity
with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her
sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as
would God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the
serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.
    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the
Archangle Gabriel ""full of grace.""  As I pointed out above this is from
the Greek word ""Kecharitomene"" which means not just full of grace, but a
plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by
the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, ""Hail you who have been and reamin
filled with grace.""  But that is a little to long to say, so it is
reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, ""you who have been"" Mary had
always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which
was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.
    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done
what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if
God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his
Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the
Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo
, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of
Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on
the matter in ""Ineffibilus Deus."""

Well, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my
$0.02.  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
damn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. 
Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the
point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!
Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad 
Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,
even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs
a power forward with some talent, IMO.

Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say
what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. 
And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. 
Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came
on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he
didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a
deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The
third goal was EN.

No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.

Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly. However, ""decibel"" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is
right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.

Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,
hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).

The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,
but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)
All the other units were defined many decades earlier.

"
83523,"The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW
as will be covered with this treatise.

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW)
is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed
the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)
through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets
till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah
SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between
571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,
is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message
of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another
messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.
He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his
coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from 
Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:

	Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,
	but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal
	of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of
	all things.

---------------------
Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,
it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The 
Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.
Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there
has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later
ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not
an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,
""for Allah has full knowledge of all things.""

------------------------------------------------------------------
   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       

(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)

   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)
declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a
decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles
which number, according to the scholars, one thousand.
The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In
fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise
Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His
miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) 
sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their
followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars
of Islam) to the hundreth degree.
   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of
the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the
effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'
   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,
while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when
you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'
   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger
claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this
universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken
order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my
fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He
splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear
witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at
this food: although it is barely enough for two or three
men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his
deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral
conduct and manners, his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.
Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the
famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief
merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this
face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'
   Although many of the  researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand, there are
thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of
his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of
truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways.
   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away; then, the
prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For
whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets.

59223,"Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year.  It is still
partially frozen, and I am still in physical therapy every week.  But the
pain has subsided almost completely.  UNTIL last week when I mowed the

Obviously, they'll be using something like triple encryption DES instead.
As long as alternatives to Clipper remain legal, Clipper accomplishes
absolutely nothing, ZERO, as far as law enforcement is concerned.
The whole scheme is an absolute, total, incredible, waste of government
time and money AS LONG AS other encryption schemes that are any good 
remain legal.  In order for Clipper to work as intended all strong

I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa
against Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally
insulting. 

I think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long
posting, and to say 

	""I don't know if you are doing so, but it 
	seems you are implying.....""

is at the very best quite disingenuous, and perhaps even
dishonest.    If anyone care to dig back and read the full
posting, they will see nothing of the kind.

I trust you don't deny that Islamic teaching has ""something
to do"" with the fatwa against Rushdie?"

Only those you haven't actually read?  Sorry, but the irony remains.


So although you don't agree with the fatwa, and apparently don't think
Rushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due
sympathy for being being under this threat.  Furthermore you base this
reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular
well-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the
absolute truth of your religion.  Yet, this opinion is formed without
recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context,
accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this
book contains and what the author's motivations are.  And then you
come forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably
""plays with"") religious/historical material because you find its
overall presentation neutral!"

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain
is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in
both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other
therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol
work better in migraine than tension-type headache.

The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got
relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than
migraine does not necessarily mean ""psychogenic""; I suspect that
organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in
migraine."

install ""scrubbers"" for diesels?  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any

Things could be worse. A lot worse! In the mid-eighties the
teen/adult sci-fi comic 2000AD (Fleetway) produced a short story
featuring the award winning character ""Judge Dredd"". The story
focussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered
multi-coloured lasers/search lights pointed at the moon to paint
images on the moon. Needless to say, this use hacked off a load of lovers,
romantics and werewolfs/crazies. The ad guys got chopped, the service
discontinued. A cautionary tale indeed!

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here,
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.

    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side.

I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too. Their Assy
numbers were not 4000-series, but your description fits otherwise. They
are 3Com 3C505's aka Etherlink Plus cards. Check out ftp.3com.com, there
are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com
cards. I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic
program for 3C505 succesfully (""..passes with flying colours"") :)

Anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS/2..?

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.
So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.

For power:

  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )

For amplitude

  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )

'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation
convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.

Common references for audio are:

	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV = 1 volt

	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)
	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)


Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.

Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

55053,"This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:

I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk
at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was
all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy
conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough
summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as
exactly what he actually said...

Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire
than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not
discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.

Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This
isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has
been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel
hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to
people like Koresh.

Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.
There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.
Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they
called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for
protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were
changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many
small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not
large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of
organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the
FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they
were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).
""All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that
power.""

The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid
illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners
no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills
disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its
existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.
Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media
is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a
pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door
and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a
gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't
invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but
if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents
removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in
chains.

The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for
review.

Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and
that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot
at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100
agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had
some medical personnel on hand.

He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest
in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on
the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and
the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could
be tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns
back.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached
rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.

The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they
audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his
followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and
they reacted accordingly.

With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates
was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that
the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their
informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had
more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been
completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to
knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for
thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,
then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns
down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF
breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the
Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served
warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A
close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_
have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was
the first shot fired!

The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial
position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the
view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held
off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI
went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was
beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the
public's sympathy.

Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,
diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents
like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,
well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have
even more tragic results.

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.
Some screens went completely (as above), others were just ""dodgy"".

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the
company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just

That is an assumption on your part.  Where is your proof that one always will
degenerate into hating the sinner, because he hates the sin.

I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America.  It is true that many
individuals hated the proponents of racism.  It is also true that many 
individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and
never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it.  Dr. King's
message was this.  Love the individual, the loving of the individual would
transform him into a friend.  However, this did not take away his hatred for
segregation.  His hatred for injustice.  



I would ask, ""Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish
Leaders of his day?""  Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers
out of the temple?

We must have at least a distase for sin.  We must in order to fight it in 
ourselves.  Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its
right name.  Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name.

It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it is
also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth.

Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship was
accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere
Institute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked
out about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private
libraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey
too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will
find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were
highly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of
the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still
being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He
was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  

Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have
misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions
do not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his
conclusions are ""spurious"" is without merit.  He gave references to all his
conclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his
conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the
individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to
Hislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions
because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that
the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown
even to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in
Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it
was so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of
seven hills?

Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own
conclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the
docrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even
have to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. 
Where did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two
tails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from
an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the
church of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,
why did the RCC chose regardless?

Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the
scriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information
from all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of
scholorship in that.

Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no
evidence supporting it.  "

* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?

  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It
  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and
  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is
  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,
  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the
  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of
  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many
  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break
  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national
  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.

  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of
  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the
  difference between public and private research in cryptography:

  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,
  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted
  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged
  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of
  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10
  years has there in fact been widespread open research in
  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts
  between these two research communities. Open research is common
  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open
  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in
  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with
  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,
  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can
  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might
  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?
  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would
  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one
  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with
  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most
  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have
  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in
  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which
  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''

* What are the US export regulations?

  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control
  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export
  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by
  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office
  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized
  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule
  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent
  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see
  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.

  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting
  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what
  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which
  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to
  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in
  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at
  least heard of the ITAR.

* What is TEMPEST?

  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer
  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that
  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at
  quite a distance and with little effort.

  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext
  is available this way.

* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?

  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for
  corrections.)

  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas
  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass
  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving
  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the
  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.
  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;
  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the
  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;
  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.

  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various
  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:

  The Beale Cypher Association
  P.O. Box 975
  Beaver Falls, PA 15010

  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the
  line:

  send index

  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.
  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher
  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,
  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)

  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of
  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI
  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.
  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this
  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an
  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this
  string.

* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?

  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis
  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with
  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes
  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in
  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,
  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.

  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;
  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent
  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.

* Is RSA patented?

  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.
  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been
  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral
  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information
  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of
  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as
  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other
  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.

* What about the Voynich manuscript?

  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the
  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list
  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>

  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich"

Something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on PGP
we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test 
new features around.  Now at this time PGP (and certainly the newer version)
was unknown over here.  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received
a request that I stop sending encrypted email.  Now there is almost no way
that some automatic scanner could have found this, since they wouldn't have
known about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the

In case people think email scanning doesn't take place, I can assure you
that it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government
agencies (or at least not that I know of), but by local administrators who,
for reasons of their own, have decided to monitor all communications
(I'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/
terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).  There
have been several occasions when I've got people into trouble simply by
including the traditional NSA bait in a message (I don't try it any more
now :-).  A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of
the UK town of Scunthorpe (hint: look for words embedded in it).  I'm sure
there are many more examples of this happening (in fact if anyone has any
examples I'd appreciate hearing from them - I could use them as

Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones, faxes, modems, etc.,

Will there be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification
(the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a
Clipper-equipted phone?

Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of
a conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically
log who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this 
information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave

This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications

Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are
	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card.

VGA:	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked
	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About
	 1/2 the speed, as I recall.

	 The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the 
	 P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid
	 is the only one I know about (I don't know about AMI) that uses
	 the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster.
	 
	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as
	 the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.
	 (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)

Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look
like?

Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?"

It's actually quite simple. We sell Drug Use Licenses to anybody over age
18 who wants one.  Costs $100 and you're required to attend a week of
night classes on the effects of drugs on the human body. At the end of the
class, you sign an informed consent waiver acknowledging that you've been
told that drugs are bad for you, but you want them anyway. In doing so,
you giver up ANY right to state-paid medical care for whatever might
happen to you as a result of doing drugs, or any right to collect welfare
or unemployment should you lose your job as a result of using drugs. You'd
also give up your right to drive a car.  

Anybody caught using drugs without a license has a choice; pay a $1000
fine and accept a backdated drug user's license, or go to prison.

If the ONLY people proposing a ""moment of silence"" are doing so as a
sham to sneak in prayers, then it MUST be opposed.  What the HELL have
prayers to do with public schooling?  [I ask this question as a devout
Christian.]



Their kids can bloody-well pray any God-damned time they WANT to.  And
nothing, on heaven or earth, in government or the principal's office,
can prevent or in any other way deal with their doing so.  *Especially*
if the prayer is silent (as bursting out into the ""Shema Yisrael"" or
some other prayer *might* be construed as disruptive if audible :-))
No one ever prevented ME from praying in public school!  They hardly
even prevented me from masturbating in study hall.

I should have thought better of someone posting from a UChicago address.
How can you manage to say such nonsense without shame?

Muslim students might have a complaint, if they are prevented from setting
out their rugs and doing the proper ablutions before prayer at the times
specified in the Qu'ran.  Jews would probably like the opportunity to daven
with tefillim and whatever else *they* require, at *their* appropriate times.
I do not see THEM complaining (though Muslims and Jews have a case that no
Christian I have ever heard has been able to make.)

The ""Christian"" insistence on a PUBLIC, UNIVERSAL, ENFORCED ""moment of
prayer^H^H^H^H^H^Hsilence"" is nothing but the Inquisition ""naturalized""

5) Anyone can build a non-key system
6) We are worried about a back door
7) Once everyone uses a clipper chip, the mechanism for a Big-Brother
   government is in place, a change of government can lead to it. 
   Especially since the escrow agencies operation is not governed by
   law (so the president can change the rules to allow free access to

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

   When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,
   the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a
   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,
   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the
   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to
   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the
   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved
   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I
   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but
   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not
   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)

It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what
happened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying
that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a
Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being
called a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an
offense, but not a heretic.

Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent
one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by
God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due
to a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes
demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human
history.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.

""Approval"" of an apparition by the Church principally means that
whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.

I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling
us what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the
doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in
knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.

Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of
apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem
at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into
someone without a heart."

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of

the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

: arrange their affairs.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, ""hi'ipoi"", the Hawaiian
word for ""cherish"" means ""sharing food"".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called ""theft"" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call ""savages"".

     I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.

     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something
very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running
into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has
not been spanked yet.
     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course
I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.

     No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall
why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time
to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the
impact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the
fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -
is called a spanking.
     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared
a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made
sure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him
lose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.
     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep
arguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.

calm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence ""ESC [ 1 B 7"" 
would indicate that the ""HOME"" key was pressed, with the shift key
down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such
as ""shift-Return"".

If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file ""x11term.c"".  Maybe if someone at OSF is 
interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got
bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about 
emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods 
somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.

Notes: 

 * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create
   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which 
   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.

 * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2
   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are
   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could 
   easily be adapted for anything else.

be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.
Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense
better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many
left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return
to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The 
rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an
interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get

	Two thoughts.

	- I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next 
generation to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown
upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that.
Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation
we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.

	- Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't
be the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out."

   _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
   no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
   to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
   ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
   by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
   least it was a good try...

So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?
Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
models.

A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this
paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject
line 
  get 9304001


Here is the abstract of that paper.

   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them
   at cosmological distances;
   but as long as there is no distance
   indicator to these events all possible sources which are
   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
   although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
   originate in the solar cometary cloud
   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

   We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE
   catalogue up to March, 1992), and
   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to
   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations
   between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,
   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,
   at least to some extent, true variations
   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$
   test to both distributions."

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for
several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system
is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted.
At the time there was no other major country with a representative body.
The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration
eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution. 

After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course
the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were 
models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged
disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal
state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were
always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had
the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of
Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due
course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon
as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period.

And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide the
world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.

If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and
have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural
being is your criterion.

But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept-
ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you 
are - I assume - worried about.

And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical,
critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and
easily led on the other.

I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief

beside the point."

and

Darren> In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources
Darren> are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own
Darren> thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.  
While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin.
Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think, 
does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed
out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.
But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe
the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For ""the sinful
mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,
*nor can it do so*""  (Romans 8:7).

Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation
(""Sola Scriptura""), but accepted the necessity of the use
of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.
Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, ""But mad reason
rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like
the works which we do, regards it as worthless."" (Large
Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more
complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many 
people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him 
described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.

We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther
was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have
come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to
recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt
compelled to defend himself and the apostles against
a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians
ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) 
as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who
examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul
said was true (Acts 17:11).

The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many
others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy
Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that
guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the
truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the
message that ""I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead"" but
rather ""I know that my redeemer lives!""  (Job 19:25).  The Christian
does not side with Pilate in saying ""What is truth?"" but rather
follows Christ, who said, ""In fact, for this reason I was born, and
for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on
the side of truth listens to me"" (John 18:37).

We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can
know the truth.  Jesus said, ""If you hold to my teachings,
you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,
and the truth will set you free"" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs
urge us ""Buy the truth, and do not sell it."" (Pr 23:23).
The Psalmist prayed ""Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth""
(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth
was in fact `in his mouth'.  

Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth
is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the
truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the 
Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready
to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther
did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly
trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his
promise of forgiveness.

REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be 
REXLEX> absolute about a thing.

Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,
Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.

I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings
of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such
reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw
the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'
than you would.

Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations
Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,
Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, ""This is my body.""

Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and
Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.

Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start
Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean
Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he
Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-
Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say. 

Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement
about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say
that if Jesus said, ""This is my body,"" then that is what we
should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because
they are not taught in Scripture.

Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also
have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to
us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, ""For
whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord's death until he comes.""  By these words we should believe that
the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as
the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*
that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that
Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because
that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is
found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary
reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can
prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.

[side remark]
I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is
con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told
me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this
is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels
to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's
Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching
""real presence"" because that was the traditional teaching of 
the church.
[end side remark]

Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning
Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we

This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations

Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK, OpenWindows, X11, XView, OLIT, MOOLIT, Motif

@ What is OPEN LOOK?
    OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of
    windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you
    edit files, etc.

    The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by
    Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?).

    See Also:
	Bibliography

@ What is OpenWindows?
    OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK
    Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the
    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,
    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.
    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.
    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the
    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.
    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as
    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.
    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,
    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.
    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:
	SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0
	Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0
	Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1

    See Also:
	Mixing X11 and OpenWindows
	Where can I get it?

@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?
    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs
    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography
    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:

    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;
    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were
    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,
    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the
    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in
    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in
    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a
    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).
    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably
    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or
    anything else that uses subclasses.
    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]

    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in
    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help
    migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be
    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.
    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is
    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).
    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.
    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the
    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be
    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.
    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much
    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.

    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based
    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the
    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of
    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.

    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some
    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to
    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time
    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.
    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the
    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.
    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.

    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++
    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from
    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify
    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be
    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the
    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.
    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of
    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in
    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).

@ Where does Motif fit in?
    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that
    is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of
    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-
    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold
    reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on
    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly
    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a
    large installed base.
    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif
    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in
    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.

@ What is MoOLIT?
    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between
    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V
    Release 4.2.
    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677

@ What about that Display PostScript thing?
    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X
    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed
    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a
    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously
    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it
    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less
    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.
    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;
    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.
    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS
    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to
    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.
    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts
    available, however)

Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm

@ What are olwm and olvwm?
    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window
    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows
    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.

    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.
    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and
    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.

    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the
    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the
    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can
    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This
    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around
    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm
    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.
    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib
    directory; there are three patches).

@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?
    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use
    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the
    footers some windows use to display certain messages.

    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus
    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run
    under olwm.
    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:
	LeftTitleButton ""target"" = f.delete
    where ""target"" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.
    Alternatively, try
	# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm
	LeftTitleButton "":menu"" = f.menu ""OL.menu""

	menu ""OL.menu"" {
	    ""Quit""         f.delete
	}

    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title
    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).

    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).

Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays

@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?
    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.
    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.
    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS
    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes
    pageview in particular.

    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-
    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)
    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about
    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.
    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you
    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's
    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.


Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows
     
@ What configuration files do I need to know about?

    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc

    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in
    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to
    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files
    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.

    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,
    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.

    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys

    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,
    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.
    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files
    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need
    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an
    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,
    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's ""contool"" program so that
    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.
    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.

    .Xdefaults

    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,
    it is a good idea to include at least:
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true
	*Input: TRUE
    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they
    forget to ask for it.

    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default
    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.
    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.

    .startup.ps

    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)
    on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the
    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change
    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a
    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up
    at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code
    that is both incorrect and insufficient.
    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.

    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see
    the man page for xset (""man xset"", and ""xset -help"") for more information.

    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of
    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of
    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for
    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime
    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to
    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your
    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...

	% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual
	% /IncludeDemos? false def

	UserProfile begin
	    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def
	    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def
	    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...
	end

    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:

	/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
	/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
	/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage

	ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload

	endpackage endpackage endpackage

    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the
    OpenWindows server like this:
	$ psh -i .startup.ps
	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3
	$ psh -i
	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3
	/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send
	%%% now press control-D

    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make
    the root window be ""retained"", so that a PostScript drawing on the
    background won't be erased when you move windows:
	frambuffer /Retained true put
    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used
    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.

@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?
    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one
    or two occasional surprises.  See also ""man 7 xview"" for a list of
    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.

    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings
    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should
    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this
    in your .xinitrc:

    if eval `svenv -env`
    then
	xmodmap -e ""pointer = 1 2 3""
	input_from_defaults
    else
	xmodmap -e ""pointer = 3 2 1""
    fi


@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?

    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but
    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.
    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as
    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system
    run screenblank automatically.

Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste

@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?

    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):
    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button
      in xterm
    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly
      XView manual gets this wrong)
    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)

    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste

   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:
    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY
    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).
    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.

@ COPY/PASTE is boring.	 What short-cuts are available?

    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:
    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go
    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button
    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined
      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)
    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.
    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.

    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection
    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-
      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button
    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection
    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse
      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the
      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).
    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want
      to drop the text
    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show
      that it's OK to drop things here
    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of
      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.

    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection
    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that
      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.

@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?

    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.
    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when
    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the
    right of the insert point.

	Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)

	Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word
	Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word
	Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line
	Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document

    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default
    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.

@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented?

    See the manual page for shelltool.

Subject: Applications: Finding Out...
    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,
    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_
    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.

    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular
    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor
    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full
    product documentation.

    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which
    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as
    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.

    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists
    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a
    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a
    faster reply.

Subject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.

@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?
    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.
    If ""man cm_delete"" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under
    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.

@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?
    The best way is:
    $ cd
    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .
    $ chmod +w .textswrc
    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)
    add the follwing:
	KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER
	cat ~/.signature
    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)

    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.



Subject: Fonts

@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?
    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).
    Or, Not Yet, in other words.

    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.
    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and
    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is
    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the
    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on
    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.

    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably
    other major foundries.

    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.

@ Improving font rendering time
    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as
    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes
    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache
    parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the
    font cache size.
	$ psh -i
	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you
	currentfontmem =	% type this line ...
	300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes
	1024 setfontmem
	% Just to check:
	currentfontmem =
	1024
    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.  You need to say psh -i
    so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page.

@ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup:
	$ mkdir $HOME/myfonts
	$ cd $HOME/myfonts
	$ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b
	Creating Bembo20.afb
	$ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb
	Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb
	Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied.
	$ ls
	Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.fb	Synonyms.list
	$ bldfamily
	* Bembo		       ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin)
	cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory
	$ xset +fp `pwd`
	$ xset fp rehash

    If you want the server to see your new font directory every time,
    add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one
    of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile.

@ Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.)
    You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a
    bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the
    fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't
    use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and
    convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or
    bdftopcf.

    Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to
    X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows.

    You can also use der Mouse's ""getbdf"" to get bdf fonts from a running
    X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf

@ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi
    There aren't any.  More precisely, the various text fonts, such as
    Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are
    scalable under OpenWindows.	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't
    scale very well.

Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages

@ No manual entry for cm_lookup

    If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are
    running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable:
	MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH
    or
	setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man
    for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.

@ window: Window creation failed to get new fd 
@ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment 
@ Cannot create base frame.  Process aborted. 

    These messages all come from SunView programs.  SunView was an
    earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked.  Some of
    the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names
    that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost
    certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead.

    Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for
    OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same), or
    you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc.

@ Trouble compiling Xt, Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass
 
    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local
    Sun office and request the following patches:
100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch
100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu

    If you can't install the patch, a workaround is to add 
	-u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass
    on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add
	-assert nodefinitions
    to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl.


Subject: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type

@ When I try to type into some programs, I just get beeps or nothing happens
    It is a good idea to include at least:
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true
	*Input: TRUE
    in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to
    receive input even if they forget to ask for it.
    See the next item for editing .Xdefaults

Subject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working

@ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs
    Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your
    $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead:

	XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \
		<Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\
		<Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
  
    You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing
    L8 (the Paste key)!

    Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it
    isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to
	/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S
    and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from
    $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.
    [See also: Environment Variables]

    This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard:
	XTerm*VT100.translations: #override\n\
	    ~Ctrl ~Meta<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0)\n\
	    ~Ctrl ~Meta<BtnUp>: select-end(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0,CLIPBOARD)\n\
	    <KeyPress>L8: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
    [Note: be sure that the \n\ is at the very end of the line, there must
     be no following spaces, and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file
     was altered must also be removed!]

    If you are using X11R5, you may find that adding the lines
<Key>L10: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\
       <KeyRelease>L10: kill-selection() \n
    before the <KeyPress>L8 line will make L10 (CUT) work as a cut key!

    If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a
    `more specific' resource name:
	xterm.vt100.translations
    will do.

@ I can't paste from XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs to xterm

    If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can
    use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively.
    You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to
    your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the
    defaults):

	Openwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy: c+Meta,L6
	OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste"", ""v+Meta,L8
    
    Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the
    thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual' from
    O'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages.

@ I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE (L8, Meta+v)
    Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the
    next item.

@ Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all (OpenWindows only)
    Oh dear.  Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running
    and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started
    OpenWindows with ""openwin"" or by logging in through xdm.
    If not, start it.  If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc
    before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can
    reboot your workstation.
    Check that there is space in /tmp (use ""df /tmp""), and also see if there
    are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are
    several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out.

    Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start
    a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files
    that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again
    after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working
    again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you
    might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without
    checking first!

Subject: Trouble Shooting: Not authorized to use display

    If you get error messages that look like
	Xlib:  connection to "":0.0"" refused by server
	Xlib:  Internal error during connection authorization check
	Error: Can't Open display
    try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11,
	xhost +machine
    where ""machine"" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.
    If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you,
    using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking
	xhost +`hostname`
    (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation).
    This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display.

    With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide 
    describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101.  This is more secure.
    Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the
    framebuffer directly!

    Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1
    to fix a serious security problem.  It is available through your local
    Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net
    [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist:
    Fix                     PatchID        Filename            Checksum
    loadmodule              1076118        100448-01.tar.Z     04354  5


    On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or
    disable the list of hosts that can access the display.

    If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight,
    there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp
    that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY doesn't have
    a hostname before the :, or is empty.  Have the system administrator
    change the cron script to skip sockets.

Subject: Trouble Shooting: other common problems

@ I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (Sun 3 or 4)
    If ""refresh"" makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later,
	you need to run ""xterm -C"" from your .xinitrc, or start one up in
	the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the
	Workspace->Utilities menu.  Better still, pick up ""contool"" and run
	that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It
	will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a
	message appears; it's very easy to configure.

    If ""refresh"" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages,
    go away...
	a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the
	mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto
	a whole new (but monochrome) display, called "":0.1"".  See the man.
	page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and,
	if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does
		openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0
	If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this
	to your .xinitrc or other startup file:
	(
	    eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env`
	    olvwm -display unix:0.1
	) &
	Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically.
	You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see
	the note about contool, above.

@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?
    Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.
    This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your
    .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.
    Keep comments by using ""comment."" instead of ""!"", for example,
	comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37

@ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit?
    set the default editor to
	sh -c ""exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \""$FILE\""""
    (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)

@ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video?
    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0,
    there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're
    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of
    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.

@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?
    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.
    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output
    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.
    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're
    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;
    the new one is fantastic!

@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays
  on the screen.
    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in
    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').

@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.
    This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to
    use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.
    
@ Why have some of my function keys stopped working?
    Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37
    respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you
    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to
    change your keyboard layout back again.

@ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version
    See under ""Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages"" below.

    (see also next item)

@ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows
    (see also next item)

    Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch
    level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to
    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with
    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.

    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows
    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.
    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.

    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions
    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a
    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory
    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have
    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in
    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead
    of OpenWindows ones!

    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11
    library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with
    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't
    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although
    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.

    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't
    /usr/openwin.

    See Also:
	Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).

@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found
    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use
	     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib
    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use
    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for
    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.

@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero
    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches
    and install the patch.

@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?
    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under
    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw
    the PostScript text and pictures.
    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0
    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.
    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace
    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to
    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)
    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.
    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with
    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).

@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?
    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from
    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z

@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?
    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties
    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.

@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool
    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also
    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.
    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.

@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!
    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be
    selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted
    in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus.
    To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:
	*traversalOn: off
	*TextEdit.traversalOn: on
	*TextField.traversalOn: on
    You can change the color using (for example)
	*InputFocusColor: grey50
	*input*FocusColor: green
	*List*inputFocusColor: <your background color>
    See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set
    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.
    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the
    OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.

@ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when
  I move into a different window! (""colormap flashing"")
    
    This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.
    However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:
    *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.
    *  Run
	cmap_compact save
       to create the .owcolors file
    *  Put the line
	cmap_compact init
       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)
    *  Exit and then restart the window system.
    *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of
	the colormap and reserves them.

    Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and
    Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.

@ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):
    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif
    window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.
    Try running pageview like this:
	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono
	$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview
	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard

@ XDM breaks things
    Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'.
    Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.
    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in
	svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic
    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.
    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security
    hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your
    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...

@ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working
    In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names (""keysyms"") for these keys was changed
    to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.	 Code which uses them should be recompiled,
    or you might be able to get away with
	xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36'

Subject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems
    This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears, which has been
    promised, but hasn't reached here.	Note that there is also a usenet
    newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very
    wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles
    per month.	You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x.

@ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items?
    PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle.
    PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.
    There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.
    You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you
    insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function
    insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits.

@ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed?
    In the button callback, do
        xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL);
    This will keep the window visible.
    You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute.

@ how do I make an XView button look pressed?
    call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are
    documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source...

@ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly
    Here is Greg Earle's patch, to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you
    should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and
    OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2, for example).
    I have edited the patch a little, so any bugs are mine [lee@sq.com] :-)

Subject: Environment Variables

    Environment variables, and plausible values to use -- this list doesn't
    take into account any local changes that you might have made, of course.
    This list is for OpenWindows 3.0 -- differences for OpenWindows 2.0 are
    marked, and I've added some comments for users of X11R4 and X11R5, too.

    DISPLAY  The name of the X Windows Display to use
	:0.0 (on the local machine, the one actually running X11 or xnews)
	:0.1 (on some machines for a second, monochrome screen)
	machine-running-unix:0.0 (on other machines)
	(You may need to do ""xhost +other-machine"" to let programs on other
	machines use your display; see also under Trouble Shooting, and see
	the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version 3 Programmer's Guide,
	pp. 101ff)
	See also: console messages, under Trouble Shooting
    FONTPATH  Where xnews searches for fonts
	/usr/openwin/lib/fonts
	(you can also use ""xset fp+ dir"" to add a directory to the font path,
	but you may have to do ""xset fp rehash"" afterwards.  This is fine
	under OpenWindows, but many X11 servers have font problems)
    HELPPATH  Where XView looks when you press the Help key (or F1)
	/usr/openwin/lib/locale:/usr/openwin/lib/help
	(On SunOS 4.0.*, or with OpenWindows 2.0, omit the first entry, which
	is for sites using a local other than ""C"" or ""USA"").
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH   Where to look to find shared C libraries
	/usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/CC/`arch`
	(the /usr/CC/`arch`/lib entry is only needed if you use C++ programs)
    OPENWINHOME	 Where OpenWindows lives
	/usr/openwin  
    KEYBOARD, MOUSE -- serial devices to use instead of the console
	(don't set these for normal use; /dev/kbd and /dev/mouse)
    PATH  Where the Shell searches for programs to run
	$(OPENWINHOME)/bin:$(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview:/usr/local/bin:.\
	$HOME/bin.`arch`:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/hosts:\
	(you will certainly want to change this example!  There is no
	$(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview in OpenWindows 3.0)
    XFILESEARCHPATH  Where programs look for app-defaults files
	/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S
        (This is set automatically by ""openwin"" in OpenWindows 3.0)
        You might want to use /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S, or perhaps both,
        separated with a :, for example (for sh users)
            XFILESEARCHPATH=$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S
	    export XFILESEARCHPATH
	If you use X11R5, you might instead want
	    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S:
	    $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S
	(put all this on one line, though, with no spaces!)

	Together with the following in lib/Xinitrc
	xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB'
	   *customization:
	END_XRDB

	xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB'
	#ifdef COLOR
	   *customization:  -color
	#endif
	END_XRDB

	you automatically get a color oclock, editres, bitmap, xcalc, and
	xlogo since they use the ""*customization"" resource appearing as %C in
	the XFILESEARCHPATH. (see oclock (n))
	according to Rainer Sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>.


Subject: Where Can I get It? Ftp, implementations, etc...

    XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and
    elsewhere.

    MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form.

    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from
    Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V
    Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version.
    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures
    is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.
    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as
    the windowing system for Solaris.

    There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either
    available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to
    be available from anywhere.  Contact anthony@ovi.com for more information.

	Specification', Addison Wesley

    The Main documentation for the X Window system comes from
    O'Reilly & Associates in about nine or ten volumes.
    The most useful for OPEN LOOK users are:
	Volume 1: XLib Programming Manual
	Volume 2: XLib Reference Manual
	Volume 3: X Window System User's Guide
	    (An OPEN LOOK edition of Volume 3 should appear later this year)
	Volume 7: XView Programmer's Manual [Dan Heller]
	    [make sure you get the 3rd edition for XView 3.0]
	Companion to Volume 7: XView Reference Manual [Ed. Thomas Van Raalte]

	The Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute
	Summary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual,
	together with other reference information, so that in practice you
	have to buy both books.

	O'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between
	X11R4 and RX115.

	OLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5.
	There is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5.

	A journal, The X Resource, may also be of interest.

    The System V Release 4 Documentation from Prentice Hall may also include
    a section on OpenWindows.

    David Miller describes programming with OLIT in his
	`An OPEN LOOK At Unix' (M&T press).
    
    Nabajyoti Brkakati gives an excellent introduction to X and to OLIT
    programming, as well as setting up and using X and OpenWindows, in:

    There's at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS).

    Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows,
    although you may have to order it separately.  Here's what I have; they
    are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper), and vary from
    about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's
    Guide' on the front.  The User manuals have a red stripe on the bottom,
    and the Programmer ones have a green stripe.

    There are also some other sets of documentation, including the TypeScaler
    documentation from the OpenFonts group, for example.  There doesn't seem
    to be a complete list anywhere.

    800-6093-10 ToolTalk 1.0 Programmer's Guide (SunSoft, 1991)
    There might be documentation about the Link Manager somewhere, too.

    AT&T includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT.

    Sun's AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation,
    including some of the O'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7, though).

    Volume 8 of the O'Reilly series is about X Administration, and mentions
    OpenWindows, although it is primarily aimed at X11R5.

    Several other books are in the works...

The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the
playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques
Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,
embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the 
playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the
Norris).

It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before 
Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--
tougher division than the Norris, also known as the ""Snorris"", division.
Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley
Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such 
powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force
in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while
over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was 
everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just
to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a
lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.

Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good
players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And
no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The
rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason
they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the
coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort
possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.


There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings
wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which
I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with
at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player
cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone
reading this will agree.  

We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they
face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,
like last year).

persistent hepatitis.  I can't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.

Much as these two terms ""chronic active"" and ""chronic persistent""
sound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!

V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two. 

How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at
130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mb/s.

[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!

never was a t'bird mentioned.  The discussion was about SHO's and
'stangs not being up to spec.  I do not know about t'birds.  I
only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded
a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff.  This does not
in any way  disencourage* me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it
a bad car.  It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra
bit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large
enough for them to fit (if memory serves right, which it may very well not)
and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it.

Local media hasn't said much, if anything, about the MOW.  Also, when
I called a straight friend in Arlington to tell him I would be on his
doorstep this weekend, he didn't know anything at all about the march.
This is a gay-sympathetic person who notices things like this.  I
thought it was strange that he was unaware of what was happening.  It

on their house, killing most of the people inside.

I'm not that annoyed about the adults, they knew supposedly what
they were doing, and it's their own actions.

What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside,
including mothers, let the children suffer and die during awful
conditions.

If this is considered religious following to the end, I'm proud
that I don't follow such fanatical and non-compassionate religions.

You might want to die for whatever purpose, but please spare
the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all.

I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity
knows about the word compassion. Christians, do you think 
the actions today would produce a good picture of your 
religion?

no argument on going direct to National (see my previous post on this topic),
but some info regarding what you said above.  I don't know about the 8250 or
16450, but NS was the original source for the 16550 series (and I strongly
suspect that they developed the others first, too).

I can also tell you that I'm one of those who won't buy a UART made by

Hello net.  I have a 386sx motherboard with the Phoenix BIOS, an on-board
IDE controller port, and two on-board serial ports.  Unfortunately, I don't
have a manual for this beast and I would like to be able to disable the IDE
controller in order to use the MFM controller I have.
The board says it is made in Korea and it uses the Chips Chipset.  If
anyone can give me a clue as to how to go about configuring the board so as
not to use the IDE controller, or how to go about finding out how to do it,
their help would be greatly appreciated.

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are
possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,
however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their
ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery, though.

About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,
""Sinus Survival"", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -
not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.

Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,
as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

gcc gave something like ""program as got fatal signal 11"" and when doing
anything past the complexity of elvis, kermit, etc, I got kernel general

Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life,
Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above 
the rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights.


As a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land
I live in, but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my 
life. If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent
that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must 
leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law
but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.

In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam
are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect
the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state 
laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws
on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving)
etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military
protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.


After the Fatwa didn't Rushdie re-affirm his faith in Islam, didn't
he go thru' a very public ""conversion"" to Islam? If so he is binding
himself to Islamic Laws. He has to publicly renounce in his belief in Islam
so the burden is on him.

You *know* that putting something like this out on the newsgroup is *only*
going to generate flames, not discussion. Try adding some substance to
the issue of ""gestures"" you mentioned.

What is it you feel that Israel *has* offered as a ""gesture""? What would
you (*realistically*) expect to see presented by the Arabs/Palestinians
in the way of ""gesture""?


What are the ""rules"" that have been bent by Arab actions? It would seem
that the Israeli deportations were seen by the other side as an example
of ""changing the rules"".

attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax
anybody else. This seems to be ok for atheists. You don't get an atheist
knocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out
literature at a social event. Theists seem to think that thier form of
happy should work for others and try to make it so. 

  My sister is a 
born again, and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family
for several years. She finally got the clue that she couldn't help.
During that period she bought me ""I was atheist, now I'm Xtian"" books
for my birthday and Xmas several times. Our birthday cards would contain
verses. It was a problem. I told my mom that I was going to send my
sister an atheist piece of reading material. I got a ""Don't you dare"".
My mom wasn't religious. Why did she insist that I not send it ??

   Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to
preach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit.
I finally told my sister that I didn't find her way of life attractive.
I have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.

   I'm sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST
OF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists. There must be an end
in sight."

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other
after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_
MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.


Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.


Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

75938,"WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi 
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the
Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives.
	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.
	""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe,
a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was
supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his
own rules.""
	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.
	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than
100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you,
quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.
I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish
race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje]
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*.
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation""
or ""tearing up by the roots.""
	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,
""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives
officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually
spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.
	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the
Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.
	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 26.
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and
an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
""months of investigation"" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of ""9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles"". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!

I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has
one.  I have my eye on two choices.

Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks
software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software
Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.

Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169
mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.

I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ($149).  

Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the
best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices.  Which should I buy?

If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would
recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range
(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help
would be greatly appreciated."

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last
May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes
the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet
must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed
manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my
truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts
rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet 
says that the noise is ""a characteristic of the transmission.""

Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the
gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about
55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,
the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should
point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a
detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They
dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for ""engine longevity""
reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.
Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times 
so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being
shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between
stabilizer and control arm fell off).

Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What
really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt
to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for 
them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new
Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never
buy another Chevrolet."

entry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They

pub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far

primarily from a conservative point of view.

----------------------------

This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and
Christians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the
question each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize
the postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes
arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people
asking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most
common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is ""how can a
Christian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about
it?""

First, on the definition of 'homosexual'.  Many groups believe that
there is a homosexual ""orientation"", i.e. a sexual attraction to
members of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual
sexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by
most groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the
term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.
This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups.  In
this paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging
in sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven't heard of any
Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who
remains celebate.

I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be
homosexual.  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.  It is
not known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence
suggesting each.  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is
not a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of
them is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help
people move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is
Exodus International"".  The reports I've seen (and I haven't read the
detailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the
Presbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that
these programs have very low success rates, and that there are
questions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly
are people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as
important as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong
believe it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact
that it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant
than the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If
it's wrong, it's wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.
If it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more
willing to forgive it.

One more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that
10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where
this came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source
of the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by
orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely
heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,
one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of
orgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have
most of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The
percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey
Institute, based on data in the early seventies but not published
until the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can't
put my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online
information for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog
at Rutgers:

This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even
been found to hold true in several other cultures, as noted in the
recent NEWSWEEK coverstory ""Is this child gay?"" (Feb. 24, 1992).  A
journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting
her book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarly
world seems to take her for a kook......

I've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enough
detail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another
view, I'd be willing to include it.)

Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.
Not all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan
Community Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to
accept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows
it, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal
Church seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that
have congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that
accept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably
only one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches
permit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is
another issue.  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual
pastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.

As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's an
attempt to summarize the issues:

The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of
homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:
""Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality"", U Chicago Press,
1980.

The argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws
in the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on
homosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some
passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.
the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was
homosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.
(There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the
entities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying
because it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in
that culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot
offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to
allow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance
for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that few
seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There's a Jewish
interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any
rate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.

I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set
of laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT
justification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.

The NT references are all in Paul's letters.  A number of the
references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly
vague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not
in the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and
/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words
actually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety
of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests
""wanton"" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous
interpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was
that in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has
vanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less
frowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the
Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He
translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none
of the church fathers understood the term as referring to
homosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the
early Latin translations, would be ""active mode homosexual male
prostitute"", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.

For a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I
Cor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.
However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not
necessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated
with some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee
say taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very
definite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it
isn't a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against
Boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a
translation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it
is that the word is almost never used.  Paul's writing is the first
occurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of ""male"" and
""f**k"" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it
doesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the
action.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.
In theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It's dangerous to base
meaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that ""goodbye"" is a
religious expression because it's based on ""God by with ye"".  However
since Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on ""homosexual male
prostitute"", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this
translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something
which Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in
their translation).

In my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans
1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something
that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result
of their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue
that this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false
gods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become
heterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in
fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is
what Paul meant.

However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law
against homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom
1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality that
appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.
Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Paul
does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.
Given his description of their situation, I rather assume that their
heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do
believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.
But in all fairness, the ""shameless"" nature of their acts is a
reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a
specific feature of homosexuality.

My overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have
enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of
homosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are
not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do
not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of
homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the
other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the
subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality
in passing.

The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages
in light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look
to Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising
that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT
prohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,
it is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of
homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing
without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As
readers of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these
approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the
mouth when they see the opposing view described.  There's not a lot I
can do as moderator about such a situation.

A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of
detailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact
I'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their
own beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the
question of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern
homosexuality.

One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds
of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act
""straight"" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying
to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions.

Another is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associated
with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It
was part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often
occured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I'm
not in a position to say that it always did, but there are some
reasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active
and passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult
to act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active
mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His
customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This
supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two
free adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.
Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,
slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible
partners.  (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from
ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve
free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations
in this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have
been discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there
surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not
involve slaves or children.)

Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against
homosexuality.  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by
promiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a
homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is
not at risk for AIDS.

Note that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt
that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,
apart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his
use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual
marriage as what God ordained.

However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning
against being too quick to deal with this issue legally.

I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is
not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's
tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating
holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues
to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to
avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.
For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat
meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about
which they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously
would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)
remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly
would rather see them married than in a state where they might be
tempted to fornication.

I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the
views Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is
not what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still
conclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the
creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This
doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The
question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful
or whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense
due to human sinfulness.  If you're willing to consider the latter
approach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more
damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.
The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often
fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from
psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when
attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.

This is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature
of homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you
may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.
Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency
to steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these
conditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are
intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for
homosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are
actually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes
AIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual
relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent
to Christian heterosexual relationships.)

In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've
heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in
this situation.  I've also seen summaries of various research and the
results of various efforts for ""conversion"".  (Aside from the
Presbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizes
our readers' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that
long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a
par with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to
depend upon such a change is clear: When ""conversion"" doesn't happen,
which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling
excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement
of life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different
context) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I
think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that
judgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay
sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe
homosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul
preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian
relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis
suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such
relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love
with each other.

There's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this
discussion.  The issue is that of ""cultural relativism"".  That is,
when Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an
eternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations
in the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist
on taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes
subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as
relative?

When looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely
rejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of
judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians
consider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as
clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:

  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in
	the OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here because
	until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding
	on Christians)
  - prohibition against swearing oaths
  - endorsement of slavery as an institution
  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner

We do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the
argument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:

  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific
	agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,
	but not to our market economy.
  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the
	same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was
	concerned about
  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people
	how to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as
	an institution
  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to
	Roman tax farming

The point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical
prohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th
Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their
relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul
would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of
argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.
Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and
many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,
slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship
between God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants
or slaves of God.)

I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally
relative.  Rather, I'm trying to say that *some* things are, and
therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in
the Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the
action we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the
one that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue
that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against
homosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen.  Those who
claim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding
themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey
all the rules listed above).

One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue
creates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --
some laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is
really idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose
words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among
Christians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to
people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.
This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as
strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments
as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I
can't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way
of justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a
dangerous situation for Christians.

On the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I
have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.
One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically
determined.  I.e. ""God made me homosexual"", and I have no choice.  I
think ""God made me homosexual"" is a fine view for people who already
believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I
don't see it as an argument for acceptability."

FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT S.F. AIRPORT

    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon
    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI
    interrogation.

By Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer

San Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the
Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law
enforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation
League was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police
said Friday.

Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after
the FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday
night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard
was returning home.

Gerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday
morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count
each of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.

If convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and
$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police
argued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. 
A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a
sheriff's spokeswoman said.

Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,
with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and ""wanted to have
his day in court,"" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and
one of two arresting officers.

Gerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from
1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett
said.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to
disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he
was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.

Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network
operated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil
rights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave
criminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said
he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.

Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's
home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950
groups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized
under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los
Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.

Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,
James Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the
interview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged
snooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any
criminal wrongdoing.

Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling
intelligence to South Africa.

ADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent
contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal
activity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest
""has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on
the case.""

Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,
according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to
pursue the investigation.

""We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly
disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement,"" said
James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.

Police, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the
inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A
former police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited
Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.

""I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but
we didn't think it would happen this quickly,"" Capt. Willett said. 
""This development really speeds up our timetable on the case.""

During his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly
regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence
division.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.

After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement
and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of
Manila.

Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines
Airlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard
after his six-month hiatus, police said.

""He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked
look on his face,"" Willett said.  ""Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'""

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish,
but there are certainly exceptions.  If you write a paper which includes
sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is
classified.  As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is
_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper.

A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are
about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you
broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge
is interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you would
be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip.

Don't tell me that you think this violates the Constitution -- find some
court cases which have struck down such laws.  Many people would not be
comforted by the fact that the government violated their rights when it

However, a Dodge vehicle (the one that Congressman Gephardt mentioned)

Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1, it does not 
run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true 
multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 
programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is
primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be
economical for most users.
	Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  
It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's 
just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs, 
and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed 
on CD-ROM.

Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements, 
and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the 
main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense 
competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will 
arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the 
client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together, 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).  
(Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't
scorn the concept.)
	Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be 
released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '96.
	With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)

   What *exactly* does the American Constitution say about ""the right 
to association"" ? 
   Homosexuals, whether Clayton likes it or not, are as much members
of society as he is. As such they have the right to participate and
have an equal opportunity to pursue their goals.
   No-one is saying that Clayton should be forced to associate with
queerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question would
object also 8-) ), but by proclaiming the general right not to associate
with them in the *public* sphere (which includes housing, hiring, etc),
he's giving his right to non-association priority over their rights to
equal access to opportunity.
   Historically, people can associate publically with disliked groups
with very little ill-effect, however cutting a group off from normal
commerce has a severe impact on their lives.
   Clayton, why exactly should your ""right"" to non-association in the
public sphere take priority over homosexual's rights to equal opportunity ?

I was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials (i.e.,
plutonium or reactor/weapons-grade uranium) one was required to obtain
a federal permit to own such materials.


Actually, why bother looking it up?  From the material we covered last
term (in 10 weeks) of Ge/Ch 127 (Nuclear Chemistry), I could *derive*
what it would take to build a bomb.  And as far as the explosive charge,
I (as a chemist) could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly
available chemicals in the garage if I felt like.  The electronics 
behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier,
however . . . but not impossible using a few ""tricks of the trade.""
And if I really wanted to be nasty, I could include a core of 
hydrogen and deuterium . . .

Of course, the hardest part is getting the fissionable material
to start with, and living long enough to put a bomb together.

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
does playing back resized movies. Apparently the process of expanding
each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
bit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work
pretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x
size or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.

He lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by
the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the
same amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in
order to keep the sound and video synced up.

The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar
performance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I
was using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.
The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice
speakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,
the QT player Apple includes with the software.

I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside
its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and
that is what caused the disk problem.

I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained

	Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your
mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big
current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output
nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.

(nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about
50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)

	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest,
6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company
name.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,
mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a
1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals.
If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info.

	Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida.
Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like 
nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices,
so they might be able to help you out.

	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.
The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd
need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......"

Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac.
The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with
the correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable
(depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC).

If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBM-formatted disk
and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBM-PC
syquest.

A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a
philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything
evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -
man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing
that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all
who consider themselves ""christians"" are (even those who manage to head
their own ""churches"").  ""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will
enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who
is in heaven."" - Matt. 7:21.


Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal
crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What
historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-
credit it as well as the Bible has?


Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you
into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving
you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:
1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain
it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this
salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain
modern offshoots like the ""new age movement"" teach or does he require God's
help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such
help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for
some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a
position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,
of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).
The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read ""A Pilgrim's
Progress,"" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).


Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a
conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You
wrote that ""I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most
of the teachings of christ"".  Well, Christ referred to God as ""My Father"",
not ""My Mother"", and while the ""maleness"" of God is not the same as the
maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not
honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,
or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent
to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - 
english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God
chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human
population.

Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of
the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the
last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this
article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I
may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of

told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to
disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.

I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things
seem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.
The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what
I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)
agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it
almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse
IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.

I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be
expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored
data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such
expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).
There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please
bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say
what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.


As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or
similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions
such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how
this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat
this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other
areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if
this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in
several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not
going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop
whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather
flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the
material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on
periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice
system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty
(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not
protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would
result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions
on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it
does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially
fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the
right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton
and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,
figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come
those consulted could be roughly described as ""us insiders""?  They cannot
quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its
exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.
Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,
past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest
and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'
or 'difficult'.


So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved
after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,
easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,
would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This
has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For
local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds
have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe
for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen
in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or
via a 'master key'?  I sure don't.

This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use
old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping
was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law
Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes
that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I
just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much
about civil and individual rights, that ""puts people first"".  The question
is ""put people first"" to WHERE?

With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T
exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword
scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific
court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.
Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that
they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to
keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After
awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks
they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would
reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember
Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?

And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!
I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice
:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to
a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded
to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get
one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important
concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...


What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You
can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.
It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the
argumet ""well, if you got nothing to hide...""  Fine. Then using that
argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in
every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but
the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a
govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as
to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are
pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.

Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish
bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.


People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,
because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some
'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother
those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.

If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public
so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few
isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a
certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected
experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was
advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the
experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper
Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled
version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the
version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who
chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...
:-)

And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT
have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?
I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything
you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this
group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...

Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not
be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure
but ""good enough"" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full
description (not a PR non-statement) of just what ""good enough"" means?
I think when saying how strong it is, ""good enough"" really means ""not
very"".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not
acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and
Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other
countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as
revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and
protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA
have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of
Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining
for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair
the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but ""too
many rights and safeguards"" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court
system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having
""too many rights"" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,
etc).

BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe
this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights
under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades
have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the
Constitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it
isn't too late allready.

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000
kms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection."

I do agree with you, in a way.  The war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion,
that doesn't mean we have to give up.  Only change the tactics.

For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.

Dealing Coke -- Death
Dealing Heroin -- Death
Dealing Pot -- Death
Dealing Crack -- Death

The list goes on and on!!!......

JUST KIDDING!!!

However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money 
away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border 
interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, ""spend it to educate 
people"", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  
things like drug treatment programs.

I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually 
prescribe and addict his ""recommended"" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,
or cut the amount down to levels where it is ""acceptable"".  Sounds good so far 
from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out 
the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)

However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be 
bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a 
recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.
The 60 Minute Report said it worked with ""cocaine"" cigarettes, pot and heroin."

   You may not think that it is fair, but how many sins do you know of
that affect only the sinner?  Is it fair for us even to be able to get
into Heaven?  Do we have a _right_ to Heaven, even if we were to lead
sinless lives?  Anyway, your argument seems to be saying, ""If _I_ were
God, I certainly wouldn't do things that way; therefore, God doesn't do
things that way.""

	""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
	ways, saith the LORD.  For as the heavens are higher than the
	earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
	than your thoughts.""

   Original Sin is biblical:

	Romans 5:12-14:

	""Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
	by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
	sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't
be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds
to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
empty. Before it gets empty.

7.1,

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even
under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with
interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V
documentation.

You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if
you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
channel and then close the channel (with the related
slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't
work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be
because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with
a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds
have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit
the sound and remove that command, then when you create your
channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you
want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you
are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.

Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the
sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses
it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you
can too.

One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the
Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not
sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your
sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the
Sound Manager."

Then you shouldn't've done it. Try answering the damn question.
I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC
in there.


Well, my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar
characteristics (front and rear disks (ABS on the SHO?), high output
V6, 4-wheel independent suspension, very good aerodynamics, 3-point
harness, fat rubber, and 130mph+ top speed). If one of them is 
up to standard (and I think the SC is), but the other isn't, then
why is that? No flamage, just curiousity.

54044,":   Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)
: when stored on a concrete floor?  

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air, which would short out the terminals.

The same thing happens to my car (Citroen 2CV) -- damp gets under the
bonnet (US: ""hood"") and shorts the spark-plugs to earth so it won't start.

The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with
WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the 
battery off the ground may help.  I'm not sure if spraying with WD-40
would be safe since it is very flammable (high percentage petroleum).

Just a thought...

I hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:

The BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in
innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will
NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment,
the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence
(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting
negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms
and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco
issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then
the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,
murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend
the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault
on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,
the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for
BATF wrongdoing.

btw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.

Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference 
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor
exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.

Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: 

  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, 
  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, 
  Doug Young, and many others.

Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional
conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object
Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server
technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;
and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.

With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing
applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a
player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many
desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be
evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and
suppliers.

The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference
at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide
the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX
developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is
the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you
what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development
Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.

I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an
Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience
is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a
confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.

No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I
thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  

The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.
The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point
the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear
to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then
pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.
It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on 
yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,
and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  

I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,
and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give
me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion
feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly
on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to
the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company
had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end
of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior
to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree
of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.

I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the
probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you
have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button
to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect
that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for
yet another reason."

completed nearly 40 hours of error free operation at 32 mhz (with a 64 mhz

On the more stupid side, I've discovered you can use a 40 mhz clock and make
your Q700 as slow as a Centris 610. However, a 25 mhz clock which would have
yielded a 12.5 mhz Quadra 700 (Who'd want one?) didn't work at all."

I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant
by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the
law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable. 




I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the 
Islamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion 
does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion 
that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However, 
I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were*
it well founded.



Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal 
act according to Islamic law.

       The ""used to kill"" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one
of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.
What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people
read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family
grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation
which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or
a tragic accident, especially involving a child.

       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority
of that 43 ""times"" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone 
intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill 
themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,
the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as
comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural
factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.
(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There
people jump off buildings.)

       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime
is commited by ""non-strangers,"" which mistakenly has been generalized
regarding the King County study to mean, ""Friends and family.""  That
is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on
the mental image that a ""Friend, family member, or child,"" equates
to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of
anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,
children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by 
someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun
was used against a ""friend"" or family member doesn't mean they
weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among
poor urban families, and those are also the areas most ""at risk""
for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may
not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban
kid might.

       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the
only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I
worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly
self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.
Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous
amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.
As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid
means of determining the success of such a defense, since according
to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report
defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders
killed.

       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a ""friend
or family member"" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense
which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in
businesses.)


       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I
will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that
culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.

       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what
it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural
lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the
exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws 
would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.

How do we measure truth, beauty, goodness, love, friendship, trust, honesty,

51749,"This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own
memory.

1)  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots.

9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard.
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position.
	
10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

12) Replace the phillips head screw

13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount"

67432,"I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux
system.

- It must be free.
- It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600)
  No motif/openlook etc.
- It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software
  works ok.
- It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents
  with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one
  of the supported formats to ps.
- It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).

I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have
no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are.

- ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows.
- support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.
- support for texts in any size.
- ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing.
- ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component
  (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle)
- any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.
- less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.
  If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the
  rest of the drawing, stay connected.

Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to
draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams
and block diagrams with it. 

I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my
whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs
with respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs
known to work on Linux with monochrome X?"

DEPOSITION OF VANYA BAGRATOVICH BAZIAN

   Born 1940
   Foreman
   Baku Spetsmontazh Administration (UMSMR-1)

   Resident at Building 36/7, Apartment 9
   Block 14
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


During the first days of the events, the 27th and the 28th [of February], I
was away on a business trip. On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-
work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the
Nagorno Karabagh region.

After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically
in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said ""uprising"" in
Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a 
demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the 
Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even 
women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, 
and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There
were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the
Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.
I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew 
wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really 
bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,
""There's unrest everywhere, be careful."" Well I had a project going on. I told
the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on 
and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they 
said, ""Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the 
police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you."" 
Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he 
knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This
man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and 
afterward he spent the night with us, too.

I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, ""The situation is
very tense, be careful.""

We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the
morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I
shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's
business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it 
and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, 
they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that
they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out 
they knew what was happening in Sumgait.

I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is
closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the 
buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two
minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private
drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, ""Let's go find some other way to get
there."" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to
take us to Sumgait.

He took us there. But the others had said, ""I wouldn't go if you gave me a
thousand rubles."" ""Why?"" ""Because they're burning the city and killing the
Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left."" Well I got hold of myself so I could
still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we 
set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, ""In fact there aren't any
Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them."" Well 
I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, 
""How old are you, old man?"" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not 
saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. ""How old are you?"" he asks 
me. I say, ""I'm 47."" ""I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'."" I say, ""It 
depends on God, each person's life in this world is different."" I look much
older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was
silent, too.

We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.
Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he
was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with
them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant
there were no Armenians with us.

I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the 
street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They
stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature 
shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .

Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's 
not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak 
their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for 
""nut,"" or ""little nut,"" as ""pundukh,"" but ""fundukh"" is actually correct. The 
pronunciations are different. Anyone who says ""pundukh,"" even if they're not 
Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, 
""There was a car there, with five people inside it,"" he says. ""They started 
hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the
people out,"" he says, ""they wouldn't let them get out of the car."" I only saw 
the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from
Baku to Sumgait and back . . .

When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,
his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in
the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. ""We're
Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here."" He did come up to me when 
we were pulling our things out and says, ""Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?"" 
But in Azerbaijani I say, ""You should be ashamed of yourself!"" And . . . he 
left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had 
to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own 
home.

They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store 
and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I 
saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I 
couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it 
was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing 
remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I
saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About
30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.

I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are
closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the
crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.
Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. 
Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the 
soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one 
armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning 
off Sumgait.

I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by 
their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I
joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us
and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.
But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly 
recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer
people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.
I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as 
to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking 
behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: ""Comrades, the Armenian-
Azerbaijani war has begun!""

The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around 
the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off 
behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, 
and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every
corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were 
doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But 
the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least
find out if my children were alive or not . . .

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ******

Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu>
Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC
Date: Thursday April 15, 1993

ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly
emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's
health care system, federal health officials said Thursday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest
findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that
sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will
put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.

Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled ""Emerging
Infectious Diseases"" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality
Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community.
The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific
counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing
threat of infectious ailments.

""This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility
to deal with it,"" said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases.

There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year
since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic,
the first in this century, she said.

Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem.
""We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past""
Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in
children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.

""Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases
would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases
remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness
and death in the United States,"" the CDC said.

It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a ""myriad"" of newly
identified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a
deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.

""The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,
such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,""
the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been
undermined by drug resistance.

HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues

The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause
damage: legal liability.

A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not
doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much
attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like
illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in
rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners
on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from
the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if
someone becomes infected while on the property.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came
after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the
Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the
disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered
the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than
$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical
expenses and lost wages.

Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or
semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the
groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.
Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a
legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential
liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard
barbecue might be potentially liable.

Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer
vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home
she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky
Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered
an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was
stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent
quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence
that a beehive was near the restaurant.

But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the
country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic
states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this
particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.

The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the
courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will
cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not
diagnosing the disease.

Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease
have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in
worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and
lost earnings.

The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more
lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of
negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing
injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a
result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property
owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many
other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the
disease.

Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &
Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help
to establish ""the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect
against Lyme disease.""

Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a
lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For
one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when
and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs
in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned
by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.
The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to
the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded
some work sites.

A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that
the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is
considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding
that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says
the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special
pants to protect against bug bites.

Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up
some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a
victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.
Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.
And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical
disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.

Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies
already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last
year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &
Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston
that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-
supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company
was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might
get infected.

Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in
Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her
organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole
Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners
Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their
100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing
pesticide.

TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.
AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,
Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson
University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30

Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is
associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients
with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.
Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and
detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not
noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract
may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding
dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may
directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the
Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological
symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was
protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological
deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme
disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential
diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder
management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic
evaluation is recommended.

Subject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles

  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the
compost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became
infected.

  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to
back that claim up with documentation.  Do lyme-carrying ticks hang out in
compost heaps?
Thank you.

As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not
willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which
is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest
purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.  

This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management
is accurate bookkeeping.  

If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it
would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What
was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the
methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  




First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I
don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,
homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be
accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of
homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  

What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things
(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific
attention.  

If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not
use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is
effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all
of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose
methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  

It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine
those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is
also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on 
those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous 
fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  

But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is
capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no
ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly
be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as
doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in
reason.

less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   "

So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.?  It would be nice to know that they were
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the

Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes.

While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  It would be a 
shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip, when
all I'd know is that someone rang, and when I attempted to go off hook the
line went dead.  Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect
directly to a modem.

The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Does anyone have
a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon?  The model
would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offs
would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence
is not right.  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used,
and its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist.
I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated.  Imagine a design
done in two layer metalization, yet finding a third layer under the
microscope.  "

  Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite
physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  If
your tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is more
likely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a medium
or small helmet.

  This works for me, and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend,
who, at 6'9"", tends to look more for women that are over 6'0"", and can't
usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had...

  Of course, if you aren't picky what size (*cough*) churchgoers you give
helpful motorcycle rides to, then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any
eventuality as far as legality is concerned, and a spare handtowel in the
tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport
(rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.

    Yow - get some sleep Brad!  You mean that people (i.e. life-is-cheap
terrorists & drug-dealing warlords) who want to communicate in privacy will
prefer to break into my house, kill or kidnap me, and steal my telephone,
rather than:

        - Spending $15 at K-mart to buy a new phone.

        - Purchasing a load of phones from the black market / flea market /
          super market.

        - Talking (*gasp*) face-to-face.

        - Walking down to any one of millions of pay phones.

        - Using messengers.

        - Going to excruciating effort to think of code phrases like ""I had
          a blowout on the freeway today"".

    Look, this system does nothing to threaten folks who _know_ they're
being wiretapped, since it's trivial to find other avenues of communication;
they'd have no reason to resort to extreme measures, since a plethora of
simple alternatives are easily available to them.

    Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system, I don't
think we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugs
murdering our families, kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up just
to steal a $15 telephone.  The system is more like urine testing:  it
catches some small number of very stupid people, has no effect on the ""bad
guys"" with at least three neurons working in unison who wish to subvert it,
and penalizes most heavily those who have no cause to be subject to it."

a fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that
the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the
Matthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the
punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or
in the sense of continual. 
 
From Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,
if it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living
forever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the 
unbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on
continually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.
It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid
regardless of its exact nature. 

There seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:
What is God's main plan on earth?
Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed
to simply destroying completely those who refuse God?

I believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship
with people.

The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more
difficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something
to avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has
nothing to do with God.

In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of
hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,
it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can
continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or
whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is
burned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a
physical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,
at some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is
no longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,
the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell
i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical
pain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are
to be forever without God. 
 
The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener
think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people
won't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of
the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening
to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.
It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is
not even remotely pleasant."

That's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on

it speak of instructions on how to act?  *Atheism is simply lack of

  Plenty of theists

I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide
can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide.
This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act,
and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.  However, since
the atheist set of instructions is the null set, how can you show that
atheism causes genocide?

Yes.  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it.
Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose
amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule

corneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who

intention of killing all the men and all the women who got in their
way. Their *own* archives remember, this is not hostile testimony.


Sound van bogged down in a ditch. No warning given.


Yes it was and no it was not. It was a massacre - the murder of hundreds
of unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting. The surviving men
were taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head. Not
intentional? Yeah right.


No it did not - you have a source for this slander of course?


The men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the
men. It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else.


On that we agree at least.


Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed.
This is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report
on the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report.
The Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour
Government. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for
some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either.
Perhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then
there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied
behind their backs, no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for
some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You
have a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it. The facts are
exactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder
nothing else. No Iraqi soldiers, no other fighting. Just ethnic cleansing
at work.

Sorry about following up my own article, but I wanted to continue

Perhap someone could conduct an experiment, taking two identical
lead acid batteries, placing both on wooden shelves, but putting
one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink.  This
would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteries
at the same ambient temperature.

I think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but the
one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have
some validity."

it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's

hardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about
dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for
dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers
seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and
cheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer
years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386

It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that he
interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con-
sciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above
that of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it
wrong.  Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously the
perceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in the
realm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound.  This difficulty of
translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been
difficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies are
so often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemed
to feel that the return of the Lord was to be ""very soon"" in the sense of
perhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of ""very soon"" has proven to
be different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescope
time, so that things that are far off appear to be very close.

Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to
happen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which
was thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy.

There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and
sincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming 
events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these 
""apocalyptic"" times.  The various predictions (I'm talking about those that
appear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com-
pletely.  One has the feeling ""something is about to start to get ready to 
begin to commence to happen"".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes,
in interesting times.

As for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn't help much.  There is an Old
Testament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether
a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That
helps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth-
quake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give
specific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they
are necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions
are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the
plane of earthly time and space.

For what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate 
could see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that 
it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti-
cipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact
a spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate
is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law,
knowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered
a priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making
true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in 
the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can
sympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same
overwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled, 
and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what 
I had seen.

178988,"Since 1979, the members of the European Parliament (the parliamentary assemby
of the European Community) have been elected directly by the citizens of the
Member States. Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just
Members of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers.

In the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats,
which increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five
years, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all
Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next
elections are due in 1994.

Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one
country to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election
of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just
used its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections.
British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per
district; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional
representation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to
be a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands).

The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its
own members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to
comply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. I
would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions:

1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every
Member State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that
is)?

2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or
more MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional
representation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per
district?).

3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be
directly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or
by the joint Member State governments as it is now?

4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for
election in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would
or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you?

5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament
or a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government
body?

6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels.
MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but
political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to
the status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament
should meet in one city only, and if yes, which?

Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930's were the cause for
the Holocaust.  Hitler told them to leave and because they didn't they
brought the whole thing on themselves.  Because as you say, they could

Same for the Jews in Europe 1930's.


You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?

Their refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal
to submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like
cowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was
COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their ""OWN CHOICE"".  Problem
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of
insurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have
that right.  


Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.
The warrant was not issued because they ""stockpiled weapons"".  It is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in

  I question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain
physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these
acts is blasphemy against God.  God caused a bush to burn without being
consumed--if I do the same thing, am I usurping God's role?  
  Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically
removing the physical ""proofs"" of God's existence.  As time goes on we have to
rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase
science is removing our props.  I don't think this is a bad thing."

I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that!
While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I
still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would
now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.
In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres
the chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of
huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. 
Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to
indicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been
for Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)
through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open
up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on
a breakaway to salt away the game).  There
is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the
victory. 

In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as
LaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get
extraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev
(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense
, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton
playing a regular shift afterall ;-)
The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog.

Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who

I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola
took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance,
several plants in different cities each made one of six partial
concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed
in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole
formula.  By now, I would guess that PepsiCo's chemists would have

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. 

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.


They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 
78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this 
time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the 
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. 

Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992

                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED

     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today 
of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and 
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them 
from retrieving more bodies.
     ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide
to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us.""

     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,
Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies.
     ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

Let me give you another story that actually happened to ME.  We sell
communications boards that use a 68000.  They used to be high tech. Our
agent in the UK sold a system to a company in CH which packaged it in a
product for CZ (London-Bern-Prague).  I telexed the Brits and told them
the Swiss need to pass export paperwork through the US as, at the time,
you needed an export lisence for these systems.

Now I knew the NSA was watching this traffic (just like they are watching
THIS traffic.)

And what do you know... two weeks later an agent of the US government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the Evil
Empire, we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly.

He was part of a FIVE man office in COLUMBUS OHIO!! who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal. (I assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there isn't
that much stuff coming out of Columbus :)

Wow, the electric utility in Prague sure is a big worry for these folks :)

The point is, we have created a giant bureaucracy (NSA) with a budget
bigger than the CIA's who, like all bureaucracies, fill their time looking
for things to do.  The Evil Empire is gone.  The NSA is not.  They will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets.  (I just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass... but that is too
much to hope for... they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like Dorothy Denning.)  Sigh..."

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's
fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation
than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is
that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he
had the free will to ""choose"" evil.  But where did that choice come
from?

We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a
tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover,
invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God
had not given origin to?

Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will?
We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me
as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like
salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.

At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly
coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...

Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had
perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an
act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to
exist for the first time?"
38259,"Hi everyone,

I thought that some people may be interested in my VR
software on these groups:

*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******

Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality
system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.

Features:

   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.
   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).
   Generic clients.
   Customizable servers.
   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).
   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).
   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily
        attached.

Functionality:

  Client:
   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things
   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's
   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's
   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to
   other users.

   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to
   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that
   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting
   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.

   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:

    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)

    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)

    o User Interface Panels

    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for
	faster frame rates)

    o Mouse and Keyboard Input

   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the
   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because
   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)

  Server(s):
   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is
   provided in this release for potential world server developers:

    o Transparent Client Management

    o Client Message Handling

   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of
accepting and
   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the
application writer
   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.

   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is
   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:

    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:
        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended
        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension
        initialisers you want.

    o Event Handler Registration:
        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback
        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.
        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)

    o Collision Detection Registration:
        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide
        some basic information to the collision detection management software.
        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.

    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because
    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects
    from which to choose.

    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:

    o Provide an initWorld function:
        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus
        any initialization you want to do.

    o Provide a positionObject function:
        This is where you determine where to place a new client.

    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:
        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.

    o Provide a getWorldType function:
        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.

    o Provide an animateWorld function:
        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects
        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit
        (to avoid outrunning the clients).

    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the
    three world servers I've provided:

        generic - 81 lines
        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the
                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future
                           versions)
        dogfight - 72 lines

Location:

   This software is located at the following site:
   ftp.u.washington.edu

   Directory:
   pub/virtual-worlds

   File:
   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z

Futures:

   Client:

    o Texture mapping.

    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading

    o HMD support.

    o Etc, etc....

   Server:

    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).

    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction

    o Etc, etc....

   Both:

    o Improved Comms!!!

I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse
software,
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure
whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(

I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of
the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I
would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

Finally one major disclaimer:

This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code
other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure
desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad
that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Disclaimer over!

Of course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with
POSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who
hates it: > /dev/null!

And if anyone wants to let me do this for a living: you know where to

Blood glucose levels of 40 or so are common several hours after a
big meal.  This level will usually not cause symptoms.


If you mean ""reactive"" hypoglycemia, there are usually no symptoms,
hence there is no disease, hence the dietary recommendations are the
same as for anyone else.  If a patient complains of dizziness,
faintness, sweating, palpitations, etc. reliably several hours after
a big meal, the recommendations are obvious - eat smaller meals."

Actually, I've got an entire list of books written by various atheist
authors and I went to the largest bookstore in my area (Pittsburgh) and
couldn't find _any_ of them.  What section of the bookstore do you find
these kinds of books in?  Do you have to look in an ""alternative"" bookstore
for most of them?  Any help would be appreciated (I can send you the list

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-
tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-
ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best
that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the
best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-
cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re-
lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that
is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the
only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-
ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-
jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.


Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.


You don't have to be rude.


For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio
Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed
that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-
formance.

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better
than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.

--> FTP

     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from

is given at the end of this file.

**********************************************************************

--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)

	In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  
Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working 
LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than 
Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK 
smaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported 
the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the 
COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For 
power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  
the  downside, the disadvantage of this update 
can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version. 


***********************************************************************	
--> For Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  
the directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  
the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 

**************************************************************************
	    
--> Introduction
   
    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems 
analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using 
Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. 
    
    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for 
undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems 
Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have 
also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, 
IBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.

    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  
Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks (""COSY_Notes"") which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books 
listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file. The contents of the notebooks in the ""COSY_Notes"" directory are

--> Compressed Files

        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9
packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:

 COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     		compressed tar file for Unix systems
	
 COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 
				format (requires the   shareware
				 Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 
	
 COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS
    
     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on 
Macintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.


--> Installation of COSY_PAK

 o In UNIX Command line type the following command:

      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -

 o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware
    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.
  
 o In IBM Command line type the following command:

      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip

NOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use 
pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC's may limit the 
directory name characters to eight. In that event type ""pkunzip -o -d 
COSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any 
Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.


     Uncompressing and untarring ""COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z"" or unzipping 
""COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip"" will create a directory called ""COSY_PAK"".
         	
Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
""COSY_PAK"" containing the following three files, four 
sub-directories and their contents:

SUB-DIRECTORIES in ""COSY_PAK"":  
  COSYPAK    - contains control tool box packages 
  MANUAL     - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. 
  COSY_Notes - contains notebooks 
  For_2.0    - contains Laplace transform package from Mathematica 2.1
  		For Mathematica 2.0 users.	 
    		
FILES in directory ""COSYPAK"":
  chap1.m   chap2.m   chap3.m  chap4.m  chap5.m   chap6.m  chap7.m
	
FILES in directory ""COSY_Notes"":
	01_Introduction.ma	  
	02_Math_Model.ma
	03_1_Transient_Response.ma   
	03_2_Transient_Response.ma   
	03_3_Transient_Response.ma   
	04_Steady_State_Response.ma
	05_Root_Locus.ma	  
	06_Freq_Response.ma 
	07_State_Space.ma         
	
FILES in directory ""For_2.0"":
	LaplaceTransform.m     DiracDelta.m	
	SUB-DIRECTORIES in ""COSY_PAK"":	Common
	FILES in directory ""Common"":  Support.m

********************* Important ********************	

	The notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the 
""COSY_Notes"" directory.  To use the notebooks, move the directory `COSYPAK' to  
a 
directory that  Mathematica can recognize :
	
        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine,
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on an Apple Macintosh,
        c:\winmath\packages                  	on an IBM PC.

	At the beginning of the ""Initialization"" cell of each notebook 
in  ""COSY_Notes"" directory, we list the example about how to make 
Mathematica identify the directory:

	(* Initialization of Path *)

	(* Example For a UNIX machine  (Default) *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""/LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For an Apple Macintosh  *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For IBM PC 	
	 *)
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,	
	 {""c:\winmath\packages""}];	
	*)	

Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
Mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$Path' 
setting.

	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory

        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on a Apple Macintosh
        c:\winmath\packages                	on an IBM PC


--> Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in 
the directory For_2.0. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 
into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 


--> Getting started

       After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the ""COSY_Notes"" directory. All notebooks load their own packages. 
Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.

--> Documentation

        COSY_PAK functions are indexed in the files in the 
`MANUAL' directory according the chapters. Usage is illustrated in 
notebooks residing in `COSY_Notes' directory.  If your computer does 
not support notebooks find a Macintosh computer and acquire MathReader 
which is a public domain notebook reader. MathReader will at least 
allow you to peruse notebooks but you will not be able to evaluate 
any code fragments.

I'm sure zero-intested economical systems survive on a small-scale,
co-ops is not an Islamic invention, and we have co-operatives working
all around the world. However such systems don't stand the corruption
of a large scale operation. Actually, nothing could handle human
greed, IMHO. Not even Allah :-).

I'll tell you all that I know about chromium.  But before I do, I want to 
get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney 
stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart 
disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to 
encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do 
most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from 
the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to 
be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.
Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have 
a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you 
or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.
Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help 
you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment 
program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When 
my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin 
E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, 
plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet 
change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.
But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation 
and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as 
your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a 
regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her 
gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even 
scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for 
the biggest Hospital in Tulsa).

One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses 
high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is 
absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have 
drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is 
really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and 
minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't 
be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a 
lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new 
Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab 
tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet 
changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you 
handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,
I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really 
don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think 
that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a 
few with an axe to grind.  That's life.

Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very 
important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor
(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine 
and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to 
form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,
and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is 
seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral 
chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest 
for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has 
come up there several times as a ""fat burner"".  Chromium is among the least 
toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really 
do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for 
chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about 
30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many 
believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I 
can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in 
Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there 
also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is 
bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when 
chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to 
Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and 
glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is 
concerned

Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, 
this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little 
more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin 
responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity 
is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular 
pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with 
glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. 
Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt 
people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, 
just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless 
they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often 
found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the 
RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would 
prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to 
check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.

You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC 
chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a 
RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail 
analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny 
business going on in these unregulated labs right now.

Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider 
chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is 
available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they 
also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not 
routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change 
and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?
Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical 
response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium 
supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of 
CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.

What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight
(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then 
exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most 
Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have 
a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  
When he or she says, ""what in the world are you talking about"", just say, 
please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook 
and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose 
tolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you 
very much."
59182,"The best way of self injection is to use the right size needle
and choose the correct spot. For Streptomycin, usually given intra
muscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot on
the upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). 
Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Make
sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the
needle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it 
pierces the skin)."

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a
misleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres
and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault
of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify
it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their
ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in
the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that
carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable
fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted
way, with inevitable consequences.

The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and
that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of
repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have
deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message
around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.
This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.

One of the problems is that you look at the world through
the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find
many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by
people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying
this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely
pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.

Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we
would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we
live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.
Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion
(I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which
would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such
subjects.

Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for
power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at
a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in
love for others.

Yours in Christ,

Andrew McVeigh


p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented
is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian.
Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour
of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for
Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs
and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time
again.

9736,"I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently.
Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I
guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get
an exact byte count.

Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating!
If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'.
If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes', 
not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only
893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say
3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying
more than 3 characters!

Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means
third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting
a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 
21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are
wrong.

By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally 
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, 
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was
terribly upset about this.

I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
doesn't have a grain of truth to it."

100,000 - 250,000


100 square kms surface, divided into city, towns, villages and
countryside.  Must have lakes, rivers amd mountains.

=============================================================================

1000.  1000 people really isn't that large a number;
everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year, and will probably
be sick of everyone else within another year.


Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the
percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there
were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.
And everyone, especially me, likes to ""go exploring""...I would want to be able
to go for a walk and see something different each time...

=============================================================================

For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enough
to have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town
""everybody knows everything"" syndrome, which some people like but
I don't.  Call it several thousand people.

For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough
to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time
getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough
for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that
5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

My desires, for permanent move to a space colony, assuming easy communication
and travel:

Size:  About a small-town size, say 9 sq. km.  'Course, bigger is better :-)
Population:  about 100/sq km or less.  So, ~1000 for 9sqkm.  Less is
better for elbow room, more for interest and sanity, so say max 3000, min 300.

If you start it with -indirect localhost, it use the loopback adress as

Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative
publications.  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand.
Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, with
the usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: media
in this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, and
such publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).  And they all say
pretty much the same thing.  I see most of them being in the range of
center-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-sky
we-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave.  There seems
to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of
understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them
(as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpret
events in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good
at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information
about them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be
clarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper had
I not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET,
let alone Internet access?

For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging.
Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not
have TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong,
so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that is
the way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren't
TOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the
problem.

And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service
(bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political
connections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if
any rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their
polticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if
they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt,
peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nasty
when someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors, etc tend to
fall into those with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the current
state of affairs.  The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi
for daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the law
he pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a less
well-connected person would have been crucified.  A typical example of
one standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.

Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solution
sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is
going on, or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position
where one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite of
a journalist in DC described above.  One notices that these less-than
complimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the
media.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views
on the subject, and it involved a 'brother' journalist.

Isn't it time for our 'objective' media, the MAIN SOURCE of info for the
average person, to start being what they claim to be, instead of spin
doctors for the Statist elements?

Carrying a pistol, loaded or unloaded, in the glove compartment, is
considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without
a concealed weapons permit.  Unless the law has been changed recently,
carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal.
I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a
traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the
seat.  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon
because it was not concealed.  The article stated that if the gun had
been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime.

59030,"Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive
_Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by
either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when
not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that
similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).  

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.  

Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved
one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having 
recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore
or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  
The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather
than being from an external source.

Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,
or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a
source of the anxiety.

In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the
individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their
daily routine and social relationships.

Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes
certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating
obsessions and compulsions.

The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the
DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .

of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to
say the original poster is already familiar with such stories.
Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill. 

Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether
literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster
no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome' is bogus.

Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of
what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo
effects; people may have allergies in addition. 


Have you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from
peer-reviewed studies qualifies as ""bizarrely cracked"".


Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC.
Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies,
for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk.


Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the
journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?

But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four
times less sensitive than humans to MSG.


The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids.
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.

Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount
of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods,
vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed
foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.



Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles
