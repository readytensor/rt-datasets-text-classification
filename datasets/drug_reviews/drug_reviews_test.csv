Not happy with side effects if miss dose or try to come off-very dizzy, sick, hallucinating etc. so have to take without fail before bed every night. slightly dry mouth. heavy sleep but good. 20 mg a day at night."
927,"For the first time in my life, I had enough eyelashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions previously but they only worsened the problem by breaking off or pulling out what skimpy lashes I did have.  After several months of Latisse I have eyelashes and even though I apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too. My eyelids became red and itchy for the first month of use.  It was bothersome but not enough that I quit using the product.  After about 4-6 weeks the redness went away and I have not been bothered by it again. I applied a single drop of Latisse to a brush and ran it along the base of my upper lashes each night for the first 2 months and now just use it about every 2-3 days and my lashes have stayed longer and thicker even with less use."
2235,"It greatly reduced the effects I get from seasonal allergies including sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and an itchy upper soft palate at the back/roof of my mouth.  It takes care of most of it, but I still get some itchiness at roof of my mouth. No side effects! I take one pill in the morning, and one at night."
1596,"Would bring down anxiety levels from an incapcitating point to a managable level on most occasions. Sometimes it could literally make the difference between being able to leave the house or not. Provided tremendous relief from the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of anxiety.

Worked very well as a sleep aid. Seldom experienced middle of the night waking. Dosages beyond .5 mg. could sometimes cause drowsiness. Not a problem at night, but had to be careful taking medication when working or driving. Initially prescribed 1 mg. 3x a day for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Adjusted dosage to take incrementally .25 -.5 mg. as needed."
2951,"After taking the Zyban for 3 weeks my desire to smoke was nearly eliminated. I had tried other methods to quit smoking and this one actually worked! Unfortunately I had a severe allergic reactions to the medication (the main ingredient Wellbutrin). I initially broke out in hives which became so severe I was taken off the Zyban and prescribed a steroid. The allergic reaction internalized and I ended up missing 3 weeks of work do the joint immobility it caused. I was impressed with the ability the medication had with my decreased desire to want to smoke, but the side affects/allergic reaction was to severe to continue using it."
1163,"cured the hyperemesis I was suffering completely with no noticeable side effects. Because it specifically treats the stomach there were no side effects to any other part of my body. I was suffering hyperemesis during pregnancy and was not able to take other anti nausea pills due to side effects and potential risks to the fetus. So this very safe, gentle pill was given to me and it worked perfectly."
996,"increased energy (moderate), weight stabilized none noted perimenopausal symptoms initiated this prescription.  Medication benefit seemed small, but just enough to balance me out.  I haven't needed to increase since I started.  Thyroid tests always show me with a ""perfect"" level since I've been taking it.  I'm very drug sensitive and have noticed no side effects.  The only drawback is having to wait 1/2 hour after taking before I can eat each day.  Other than that, it's great - it's even inexpensive to buy!"
1939,"Ive been taking Tramadol for 2 weeks now. Ive been taking vicodin and percocuet for 7 months due to Cervial disk degeneration and lower back pain. I have to admit I loved taking Vicodin and percocuet. The problem is that they would knock me out. Tramadol has been awesome. It takes 90% of the pain away and I feel like I actually have energy again. From reading previous comments it sounds like I take a lower dose. Im really happy about that cause if I get use to it then I can up my dose and not feel worried about it. I have had no side effects so far. I hope it stays that way. Treating for neck, shoulder, arms, lower back, hip, thigh and knee pain."
3420,"At first my skin was looking really great it even made my wrinkles less noticible. I seemed to have grown sensitive to the medication after 6 months and I was a mess.  I had a face of red, sensitive, peeling skin. Pea size amount rubbed into facial skin every evening."
1218,"This medication did not make me sedated or cause constipation like the last one I tried and I had no trouble getting to sleep at night. On the first day of taking this medication, I became extremely high and anxious within an hour of taking it.  I then went on a major shopping spree, had major increased energy and talked a lot more then I usually do.  By the second night, I started crying and could not stop and my teeth would not stop chattering.  Over the next few days I became like a zombie during the day, but by night I would be a crying shaking mess.  On the last day of taking this medication I was truly suicidal and I was not even depressed when I started this medication a week earlier.  This medication was to treat severe anxiety only, and it did help for this, but made me severely depressed as a consequence.  This medication may be very beneficial for some people, but it did not work for me. I started taking one 10mg tablet of Fluoxetine in the morning for three days and then changed to one 20mg tablet in the morning"

3703,"I was a lot younger than what is normally recommended when I started taking Effexor at 15, but along with this help of a great therapist it definately seemed to lift that ""cloud"" of depression and my anxiety attacks and insomnia disappeared. dilated pupils, increase in heart rate. When I was being ""weaned"" off it, I had a lot of dizzy spells I was put on a 37.5 mg dose once daily for about a month before it was increased to 75 mg. While I was using this prescription, I had regular meetings with the psychiatrist who prescribed it to track my progress and I attended therapy sessions once a week."
3344,Lowered cholesterol well Aching and weak muscles Changed to another drug. Now taking Crestor
1983,"It assisted the ibuprofen and cortizone in pain relief. I had no side effects. I have severe tension headaches on a every other day basis.  Occasional swelling in the top of neck. if ibuprofen didnt do the job, fiorinal usually topped it off.  but this medicine alone didnt do much for me. I was prescribed 1 to 2 pills every 6 hours when headaches occurs."
217,"elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed. none at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage. Initial treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation."
4036,"Mild lightening of age and sun spots. Slight dryness at the beginning of treatment. Increased sun sensitivity. Started using the cream every other night and increased it to every night. It somewhat lightened my freckles and age spots pretty quickly (within a couple of weeks) but after that stopped helping. I also had a brown patchy area on my leg that has been around forever. I used it as my ""test"" patch to monitor progress. Just like my face it lightened the spot pretty quickly and then stopped working. The spot since then has remained lighter but has never gone away altogether. 
I would say I saw a 25% improvement in the sun spots on my face.  I have a lot of them so overall it didn't really make a difference in how my skin looks. 
I did not have much irritation when I started using this product but I had been using Retin A before I started the Tri Luma so maybe my skin was used to it already. I did notice that it stung the skin around my eyes when I used it on the brown spots high up on my cheekbones.
Also, was told it would help reduce acne and breakouts.  It did not which is disappointing. 
I use 50+ sunscreen every day and stay out of direct sunlight."
1462,"Taking the medicine was only once a day at the time I chose to take it. It helped me most during stressed situations of any size. I could handle anything and not get angry. Mild headache and mild stomach ache I take Cymbalta for depression and anxiety. Right away I noticed a difference in my behavior. It took awhile for them to even out, so I didn't rely on my next dose."
3777,"I took my puppy to the vet. The puppy was having diarrhea and vomiting. The vet gave him metoclopramide (perinorm) for vomiting and Metronidazole for diarrhea. 
Within 2 days the puppy died. He was so weak after metronidazole that he could not move . He was quiet ok before I took him to vet. Extreme weakness, extreme nausea, the puppy had not taken any food, but he was still vomitting or having anti-peristaltic movements all the time and he died ultimately because of lack of energy. He was given Metronidazole, Metoclopramide for his nausea and vomiting. I would say the metronidazole may be useful for some but it caused death of my puppy. I am a healthcare professional and I know what metronidazole does."
1859,"No benefits, did not help the initial problem of the sinus infection severe diarrhea with blood/mucus caused by c difficile infection that led to colitis.

1982,"This drug does an excellent job of relieving my headache pain.  No OTC drug comes anywhere near reducing the pain like this prescription does.  What I used to do for headache pain is lay down in a darkened room with an ice pack on my forehead.  If I could fall asleep usually the pain would be gone when I woke up.  Problem is that it is not always possible to find a quiet, darkened room when a headache comes on.  This prescription relieves pain completely within 45 minutes. I feel kind of spacey for about an hour after I take it.  Do not recommend driving, or trying to think or make decisions during this time.

In addition, I am worried about getting hooked on it.  I find now that I am taking these pills more often.  Also, I notice that now I cannot tolerate headache pain without these pills... same pain as before only now I just can't handle it at all. I have (what I think is) sinus-related headache pain.  Pain is always in the forehead on the right side.  Changes in barometric pressure always bring a headache on.  Sometimes the pain is so bad I vomit.  I had sinus surgery (drilled holes in sinus cavities in forehead... sorry I don't know the medical terminology).  This relieved the headache problem for about 5 years, but it is  back again.  I think I would rather have another surgery than continue to take these pills."
2706,This worked better than an estrogen patch.  I felt better and vagainal atrophy was almost cleared up. None that I can tell. Rub one packet of gel on the top of either thigh daily.

I could bite someone's head off very quickly.  After taking the drug, I am now such a nice person and genuinely care about other people and realize that everyone is different...........and that's ok. None Once a day dosage in the morning with breakfast. I cannot believe I ever lived a happy life before this drug."

Also, I have yet to become pregnant, but I still use additional protection at all times. None. I don't understand how it could bring about side effects really. It doesn't cause weight gain. If you gain weight on this, it's your own fault for eating too much! =] The only thing I can think of is when I go to the bathroom it comes out a bit, but nothing that can't be fixed immediately. Never come completely out yet without me physically removing it. Simple. I would 100% recommend this."
2517,"loss of stiffness and more mobility.  After a heavy weight workout, taking Miotrin relieved the stiffness and iflamation around lower back.  Next day mobility and flesibility was much greater, and less pain. none. either before or after a workout, usually take about 800 mg of Motrin with lots of water or a glass of milk. Also, use a heating pads against lower back.  It works great with motrin."
903,"There were none at all. There were many side effects such as mild hallucinations, major heart palpitations, and increased anxiety. I took Paxil for 2 weeks and after experiencing the horrible side effects I decided to tell my doctor that I wanted to stop taking it. My first 2 - 3 days were fine, until the dose was increased. Overall, this drug had to many negative side effects to be effective."

It's one day later and I still have the rash and am exhausted. Stay away. don't take it."
942,"Although I took this drug about 3 to 4 days before I realized it was making me sicker, there were no treatment benefits during the time I was on it.  Actually , I started feel worse about day 3 or 4.  The drug seemed to be enhancing the sinusitus symptoms! The treatment side effects of Levaquin were very similar to my sinusitis symptoms, hence the fact I stayed on the drug for several days.  Side effects included headache, dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea (nausea is not a symptom of sinusitus that I ever experienced before).  The side effects slowly got worse the longer I took the drug. I asked for the drug in liquid form, as I have difficulty swallowing many pills.  I took the drug as recommended, but the symptoms did not get better.  As I mentioned earlier, the symptoms got worse.  I called my doctor's office on the third day and was told that the symptoms I was experiencing was the infection.  By day 5 I knew it was the drug, and stopped taking it.  After a couple of days the nausea went away, and eventually the sinusitus infection slowly got better.  I will never take Levaquin again!"
3252,My acne improved when accompanied by monthly exfoliation peels. My skin was very sensitive to sunlight and it was difficult to protect my skin given the sensitivity of creams to cause acne flair ups. Application of creme to clean skin in the morning and evening. It was the most effective acne treatment I have used that didn't cause excessive drying or irration to my skin.
1861,"Seem to have a bad sinus / nasal infection, now up into ethmoids.  Seemed to start with attempt to drain tear duct, but blocked.  Helping but not kicking it.  They've now changed me to my choice of Omnicef or Levaquin, I chose the Omnicef.  We'll see if it does the trick. None.  I do pretty well on penicillin type drugs. Given to me by my PCP for sinus infection."
3200,"This drug worked as a treatment for strep throat. Behavioral changes including extreme irritability and aggressiveness. While these changes started while taking Omnicef, they continued for months afterward. My daughter also developed food sensitivities. From careful observation, I surmise that this drug caused severe inflammation in her gut that we are treating with probiotics. We are seeing some improvement with avoiding foods such as milk and egg as well as diligently taking probiotics and vitamin c."

985,"Very well managed blood pressure within normal, healthy range.  I had an allergic reaction to a more common blood pressure medication, Lisinopril (which is a combination of a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor).  The newer Tekturna has worked perfectly for me with only the slightest dizziness when I rose too quickly early on, but no side effects at all after the first few weeks. I had a very slight issue, early on in treatment (in the first few weeks only), of slight dizziness when rising quickly from either laying down or from bending over with my head down (such as when petting my cat when she was laying on the floor), but that fully resolved quite quickly. I have not had any other side effects at all. I take one 300mg Tekturna per day, in the morning, along with 10mg of Terazosin (Hytrin) and my blood pressure is wonderfully under control. My last blood pressure reading was 110/66 which is perfect!"
576,"Mood more level. My speech is slower, not as pressured. I tend to listen better. I feel more ""chill"", though I still do experience free floating anxiety. My mood is significantly improved, but the anxiety, while lower, is the most stubborn of the symptoms. Thirst, tremor, slight weight gain, occassional nausea I have been taking the medication for a year. I had started at 900 mg daily, but found that while I was improved, there was still room for improvement, so the dose was increased to 1200 mg/d. Of all the medications I have taken for bipolar disorder, this has been the most effective; and the cheapest too lol!!"
3360,"Reduced cholesterol levels after approximately four months.  Have been taking the medication for approximately forty eight months on a regular daily basis. There were no side effects.  Annual liver function and lipid tests are required by the physician. As stated above, initial blood tests to determine cholesterol levels. Then was put on a maintenance dose of the Lipitor and I have been taking it for approximately forty eight months.  No side effects.  Annual blood test to determine if there are negative effects on the liver functions."
882,Significantly decreased depression and anxiety. More effective than Lexapro which was also taken prior by patient. Definitely a more effective product. None which was an improvement from Lexapro which caused insomnia and fatigue. Did not experience any significant side effects. Taken daily at night before bedtime.

686,"eventual reduction in acne made it worse before better, left me with scarring, dry mouth and hair loss daily tablets"
2398,"I saw a large improvement in my skin which had become very dry and flaky on my legs and also on my face.  I have a blood test every year and after the initial experimenting with the dosage which started at .50 my thyroid levels are normal. There are no side effects that I have noticed. I was surprised when informed by my doctor that my thyroid level was low.  I didn't associate increased dry skin and perhaps slowing down a bit to thyroid levels.  Although, after talking about it I realized it ran in my family.  My mother and brother were also on thyroid medication."
2624,"The main benefits were absolutely no pregnancy and no menstrual cycles. The main side effects, which I noticed more predominately in the later stage of treatment was the contast hunger and weight gain as the result, moderate acne, and depression (I am still being treated for depression so this may not be due to depo, but it is actually one of the side effects). I started depo-provera when I was 15 years old and continued treatment for five years and then stopped treatment at the suggestion of my doctor to take a break from it.  During the first ive years on depo, I had no adverse effects I maintained a constant weight of 112-1/2 pounds throughout the entire five years.  I started depo again at the age of 23 and was fine and maintained a constant weight until they switched me to the generic version at the age of 27 from that point on I struggled with constant hunger rapid weight gain and struggling to keep it under control, acne is another of the side effects I experienced after the switch to generic and depression.  The depression could be the result of fluxuating weight and acne or heredity.  I stopped depo treatment and switched to the copper IUD in November of 2007 and since then the constant hunger has stopped, I have already lost 10 pounds without really trying and the acne is beginning to decrease.  I still am receiving treatment for depression at the moment.  Hopefully, this will help you in your birth control decision."

4107,"I was able to quit smoking after 7 days without major withdrawals. I experienced vivid dreams. I tried on numerous occasions to stop smoking but was unable to remain smoke free.  I read about Chantix in a magazine and set an appointment with my doctor to see about getting a perscription.  I began my therapy, set a quit date for one week later.  I followed the instructions and noticed at approximately day three, that my cravings had eased somewhat.  In the days that followed, the payoff I usually recieved from the nicotine no longer had the same effect.  This was somewhat annoying to me, however I continued with the medication until I finally quit smoking.  I have been smoke free for over 6 months off the medication.  Chantix is one of the most effective medications I have ever used.  It really worked for me."
207,"Fast acting, did not have to worry about skin thinning None that I noticed The treatment consisted of applying the cream form of Pimecrolimus twice a day on the face for eczema treatment. The cream itself wore off very fast which limited how effective it acted. However, benefits were seen within the first week of use."
3153,"The drug really did help the inflammation of the lungs and cut down on the cough. Stomach upset,hunger, which lead to overeating, severe acne breakout of the face. I had a pretty bad case of pneumonia, which had culminated in a horrible hacking and convulsive cough that I could not get to go away. I was given Ceftin (I believe, can't remember the dose).  I was also prescribed an inhaler and the prednisone. I had never taken a steroid of any kind before.  The first couple of days were okay, though I noticed I felt constantly hungry or my stomach hurt slightly, it was actually hard to tell which it was. So, I was eating a lot of crackers and thinks that I thought would help.  After the five days my skin began to break out all along the jaw line and forehead, which was not usually a problem for me. The breakout was so bad, I went to see a dermatologist who put me on a month of tetracycline, which cleared up the skin.  Overall, the prednisone made me feel lousy!  I hope I never ever need it for anything again."

1277,"Taking the provigil has allowed me to keep working fulltime; otherwise I wouldn't be able to function well due to the extreme constant fatigue I experience related to MS. My neurologist suggested I try this.  It has helped considerably during the daytime with my concentration level and also has helped me to stay focused. Provigil works well for an approximate 3 hr. period, but wears off shortly after that. I do experience slight rapid heartbeat initially and feel jittery for a short time but it goes away quickly. I currently take 100 mg. and if needed, another 100 mg. in the afternoon.  I don't take this any time after 2 pm as I'll be up all night.  I do need to take a prescribed sleeping pill in order to get to sleep since I've been on Provigil.

There were no side effects other than slight drowsiness with the first few doses.  After first few doses I didn't notice the drowsiness anymore.

2875,"My skin felt much softer and my breakouts were far less frequent. My pores also looked smaller. The routine was also easy to maintain, as it only required nightly application. My breakout were more frequent and severe when I first began this treatment. Also the cream itself was a little to heavy, it may work better for those with dry skin. I did not notice increased sun sensitivity or significant dryness. I would have preferred this treatment if it was a gel or a light lotion, and not a heavy cream. I would apply the Avita 20 minutes after washing my face every night, wash it off in the morning, and apply sunscreen on my face."
2105,"My skin is clear and people have complimented me on the appearance of my complexion.  My rosacea is under control, my hyperpigmentation is fading No side effects except that I notice my skin is a bit tighter/drier, but this could be because it's winter  and I need a much better day/night  moisturizer. I alternate glycolic acid 20% cream, tretinoin .05% cream, or Noritate cream under day or night moisturizer (ie a different treatment applied morning and night; the next day starts with treatment not used previously)"
474,"I have a bad case of Crohn's disease.  Mine is fibrostenotic crohn's.  I had a stricture that was causing my pain, but severe bathroom visits.  The stricture was fixed with surgery.  The frequency of the bathroom visits is lessend with Remicade.  It helps within 1 to 1 1/2 weeks.  The only bad thing is that I find myself needing it desparately at 7 weeks.  I suffer for 2 weeks then until I can get it and let it start working again. No side effects for me. It takes 10 minutes to get registered.  Another 30 minutes to get my IV started and my medicine ordered and brought up.  Then it takes about 2 1/2 hours to infuse."

My severe pain and joint swelling diminished soon, and I have had few painful moments (and nothing like the pain I had before my diagnosis).  I have stopped taking plaquenil.  The only side effect I have noticed is thinning hair.  I miss having a glass of wine once in a while, but the lack of pain makes that sacrifice worthwhile.  I take folic acid each day."

Cocaine got me through grad school & my thesis, but ritalin allows me to function with out illegal stimulants -- problem is finding a doctor who will write rx for the dosage that is most effective (i.e. 20 mg 5x / day).  I am interested in a study that monitors efficacy / tolerance in patients who need / take high dosage on a long term basis."
1260,"improvement in daytime wakefulness without the ""peaks and valleys"" previously experienced taking prescription Ritalin for this condition. There's no excessive nervousness or feeling like I'm taking speed.  I just don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep. None that I'm aware of.  I am starting to wonder if it has effected the health of my gum tissue, but there is no documented evidence to support that. Once daily medication to deter excessive daytime sleepiness associated with sleep disorder Narcolepsy.  Downside of it is that it is VERY expensive."

635,"Very effective at preventing pregnancy.  Also regulated menstrual cycle length and helped relieve acne.  The best part is that you only menstruate 4 times a year, as opposed to 12 or 13. During the first two months or so that I was on Seasonique, I experienced rather severe depression and uncontrollable mood swings.  I also had issues with breast swelling and tenderness.  I spoke with my doctor and he advised me that such side effects, although very uncommon, almost always wore off after the first few months.  I decided to stick it out and sure enough, they wore off as my body grew accustomed to the medication. You take one pill every day, preferably at around the same time."

Given 1mg Propecia for ~one week in 10/05, noticed instant compromise of sexual capacity and an increase in anxiety & confusion. Stopped because of this experience, however did not completely regain libido, sexual function or mental sharpness as promised. Tried treatment again two years later thinking my experience was normal and would subside with continued use (as indicated in drug info), until the same exact thing happened. I researched the symptoms and learned I was not alone thanks to propeciahelp.com, I stopped once again and have strived to reverse the damages since to no avail."

Expensive, but well worth it."
1639,"IT WORKED FOR RELIEVING SOME OF MY NECK AND BACK PAIN.  PLEASE NOTE, MY CAUSE OF PAIN WAS DUE TO SURGERY PAIN AND NOT YOUR NORMAL KIND OF BACK PAIN.  I MUST SAY THAT IT JUST KIND OF TOOK THE EDGE OFF OF THE SEVERE PAIN I WAS FEELING.
AS TIME WENT ON I BEGAN TO HEAL AND FEEL MUCH BETTER AND NOW IT TENDS TO WORK MUCH BETTER. SOMETIMES TROUBLE BREATHING AND TROUBLE URINATING.  ALSO, FELT DROWSY DURING THE DAY.  THE BREATHING AND THE URINATING PROBLEMS STOPPED AFTER ABOUT A WEEK ON THIS MEDICATION.  AS FOR THE DROWSY FEELING, I STILL EXPERIENCE THAT AND TRY NOT TO DRIVE WHILE ON THIS MEDICATION.  I EXPERIENCE NO OTHER SIDE EFFECT EVEN THOUGH I AM STILL TAKING THE MEDICATION. DUE TO A SLIP AND FALL ACCIDENT, I NEEDED TO GET BACK SURGERY FOR MY CONDITION.
THE TYPE OF SURGERY I HAD WAS CALLED ANTERIOR CERVICAL DISKECTOMY AND FUSION FOR CERVICAL DISC DISPLACEMENT.  THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBED OXYCODONE ALONG WITH NAPROXEN.

539,"This medication was the only thing that was able to put me to sleep regularly after over 20 years of chronic insomnia! There were no side effects. I usually took 150 mg. per night.  Occasionally it would have trouble falling asleep again, and then I would increase the dose to 200 mg. for a few days.  I would then go back to 150 mg. once I got back into a regular sleeping pattern.  Although Trazodone is a mild anti-depressant, I did not notice any difference in my mood."

The drug got rid of the problem very quickly (within a month) but it came back worse a year later.  It was highly effective.  I should have treated my condition earlier as all of my chest and half of my back was covered with painful acne.
936,None Severe dizziness and nausea I went to Dr because it looked like a wound on my leg from a scrap was getting infected.  He prescribed Levaquin for 10 days.  I only took one tablet and within 2 hours I felt very lightheaded and nauseaus.  I actually had to lay down and have someone call the doctor for me.  They told me to quit taking it and put me on Cefadroxil (generic for Duricef) instead.  I tolerated that fine.  Levaquin is a very expensive antibiotic and now I'm stuck with the cost of that.  They should just give it out in 1-2 tablet doses first to see if you can tolerate it before you get a full 10 day supply.

676,"the benifits of the treatment were that it stopped the pain. i could sleep at night. i could eat food that i could not eat before. because i was not in consent pain i could get on with my life there were not any treatment side affects except that you had to take two tablets twice a day for the rest of your life. this was not a cure. I THEN FOUND OUT THAT THER WAS AN AUSTRAILAN  DOCTER WHO FOUND THAT IN SOME CASES ULCERS WERE ONLY A BACTERIA AND A SIMPLE TEST WOULD FIND THAT OUT AND IF THAT WAS THE CASE A SHORT COUSE OF ANTIBOTICS AND AN ANTI ACID FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME WHISLT YOU WERE TALIKG THE COURSE OF ANTIBOTICS, WOULD GET RID OF THE PROBLEM, WHICH IN MY CASE IT DID.

My mornings are slow, but than again I've never been a ""morning person"". One cup of tea and I'm good to go. I take 1 mg before bed.

Now I am taking Nexium, which works very well for me."
1165,"The oral disintegrating formulation of zofran is very easy to take, especially
in cases of severe nausea. Some side effects that are very tolerable include fatigue and slight head ache. You take one pill to dissolve on the tongue every 6 to 8 hours as needed for nausea and vomiting. This drug used to be used for chemotherapy patients, but now is more widely available for others. For gastroenteritis, it is very helpful for comfort and maintaining hydration."
214,"The Trental reduced my viral load, increased my sex drive from none to moderate and the side effects were just some stomach upset, which was fixed by reducing my dose to twice a day. Mild nausea and mild dizziness that were dose related. I wanted to see if the Trental would reduce my viral load and it did."
2868,"NO LONGER ANY KNEE SWELLING.....TOTAL KNEE MOBILITY... NO PAIN... THERE WERE NO NOTICABLE SIDE EFFECTS...SPIRALACTONE ACTS AS A WATER PILL SO THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF URINATION.  THATS ALL... after two shots of cortisone to my knee, I had an mri done...this showed no problems yet the cortisone injections lasted only about four months.  My dr did not want to give additional injections and prescribed physical therapy, which I did, but it only aleviated the pain for a short time and never for an entire day.  My job requires me to be on my feet and I needed more relief.  I went to an internist (the first doctor was a bone and joint specialist) who prescribed spiralactone.  OK, I didnt have much faith in a water pill, but it worked and still continues to work.  I do not take many medications but I do make sure I never run out of this miracle."
2581,"The ointment kept the symptoms of the dermatitis(i.e. itching, scaling and cracking) to a minimum.  As long as the treatment was part of my daily regiment it was very effective. When I fell behind on the regular application of the ointment, the dermatitis would flare up within 2-3 days.  Unfortunately, the ointment fails to ""cure"" the problem and only treats the symptoms. The application is very simple.  Just apply the ointment to the affected area(bottoms of my feet) twice a day.  The Dr. recommended I exfoliate the area regularly to remove any build-up of skin.  Following that recommendation I would use a pumice stone 4-5 times a week prior to applying the treatment."

This medication stopped the sneezing for about 4 hrs.  Then it resumed as did the continuous runny nose.
Directions say take 1 only every 24 hrs.  I won't buy this medication again.    No noticeable side effects at all except it certainly didn't work at all."
3447,"the benefits were, I was taking it for excessive prolong spotting and bleeding. Slowly but surely everything did go back to normal, no more excessive bleeding or spotting but it did take like 8 months. the side effect for me was weight gain and depression. Treatment was to be ongoing for six months to treat condition. I was to take it 10 days out of the month. During treatment I had break-through bleeding and very bad cramping, though I do not think directly connected with treatment. I gained weight, but soon took off through walking running and other activities. I went through a very bad depression, resulting in me taking another medication for treament of that. It wasn't until I went off treatment until everything got back to ""normal"" (no more excessive bleeding or spotting in between periods)."
1019,"Helps with concentration and staying focused. Helps to keep me from being hyperactive and fidgety and helps with memory to an extent. If I am stressed, I seem to be jittery and the benefits are not as prominent. I was diagnosed with ADD three years ago. Have tried several different prescriptions and found the best results from Adderall and Vyvanse."
2125,"I used the product to try to reduce previous sun damage as well as discoloration and wrinkles created by aging (I'm currently 50).  I feel the product did even out my skin tone at least somewhat however did not remove the larger areas of discoloration due to sun damage.  Overall the condition of my skin did improve, however the effects were not as dramatic as hoped.  This may be due to the discontinuation of the 0.05% formulation which would of course be more potent that the 0.02% that I could get.  I will try Retin A next time around to go for the 0.05% and see if results improve further. Treatment side effects were overall very minimal.  I had been told to expect a considerable amount or redness and perhaps flakiness.  This never occurred whatsoever and virtually no affects from application itself were noted.  The two items that were noted is that I was initially not aware you could not receive waxing while using Renova and had a burn resulting from an eyebrow wax.  I also did find, as stated, that I would burn much more easily in the sun. My skin care program prior to Renova was wash with Cetaphil, tone with a Paula Begoun antioxidant toner, 8% glycolic acid gel, moisturizer.  Same in the evening.  After adding Renova, same routine in morning but in evening I went to:  Wash with Cetaplil, tone with same product as before, wait 30 minutes, apply Renova.  On alternate nights, I add a Skin Recovery Antioxidant about 30 minutes after the Renova."
1438,"more energy and alertness, less fatigue & regular normal period duration. Periods had been irregular, and often very heavy with severe cramps and clotting. Mental attitude improved. I became less tired during the day and required fewer hours of sleep to feel fully rested. Concentration improved and thought process seems much more clear after taking the medicine for about four months. none, I felt not ill effects simply taking medication daily"
410,"Complete relief from pain with one 100 mg tablet. Alleviated the sensitivity to light, noise and nausea. Symptoms would abate in one to two hours. A little ""fuzzy headed"" until it took effect. This is taken as needed. It works best to take at the onset of the migraine and not to wait to see if will go away."
3297,"Panic attacks and depression completely alleviated; true 'happy pills'. I wish I could keep on taking them indefinitely as I am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future, where I am unhappy and stressed, which can and does lead to depression and negative, sometimes suicidal, thoughts. I found Sertraline completely ineffective for my IBS. After taking drug for 4 months I developed (for want of a better description) 'muscle jumps' (more severe than twitches and different from tics) which could occur in any part of my body, causing a literal 'jump' in the affected body part!  These only occurred when I lay down - usually when I was in bed, but didn't occur when I was up and about moving around. I gave up taking Sertraline completely on my own volition as the condition was getting worse and although more irritating than serious, it started to interfere with my sleep.  The condition took around 2 months to completely disappear."
3594,"Smoother and clearer skin, believe it may act as a Vitamin A derivative and promote faster cell turnover. My skin had less cystic boils and lesions, skin was less oily and seemed more resilient, but you have to be careful with the dose otherwise skin can become more sensitive, and sun block is recommended with this medication too. Skin sensitivity can increase if you use too much of the product. When it says apply a thin layer, it means a very small amount - it goes a long way! For me this  was the only real side effect. Treatment is simple - after cleansing the face gently, apply a thin layer of the Differin gel to the skin before applying anything else, in other words it should go underneath any moisturiser or any other product you are using so that it is in direct contact with the skin."
3322,"After a month taking, the cyst is shrinking considerably. It was a few cm big. By the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. I'm cyst free since then. It stopped my menstrual cycle but after three months, my period came as usual so it's not a big problem. But the worst side effect for me was I got acne which was severe and left pitted scars. Not only that, I noticed my skin (whole body and face) after the acne stopped was very very dry and aged very fast. It took long time for my skin to become somewhat normal again. Hairs on my legs were getting longer and more prominent too. And another side effect was weight gain with enormous appetite which you could feel was not normal appetite. I gained about 8kg and then lost it which result in sagging skin on my face. The treatment was easy enough. The gynaecologist prescribed Danazol for the ovarian cyst I had and it was very effective. The cyst was gone and didn't come back too."
3471,"I did go to sleep more easily. I'm not sure how effective the time release is, because I often would wake up 4-5 hours later. Sometimes I didn't take it to sleep, but upon waking at 3pm, would take one to go back to sleep. They say to not take unless you have 8 hours to sleep, but this is not the case with me. The cutoff time is 4-5 hours. I sometimes feel groggy the morning after. The one time I took it nightly for 3 weeks, I had been under a great deal of stress, and then jet lag (I travelled to Europe). In addition to the grogginess, I also just didn't feel good.Very hard to describe, but a bit rundown and not clear-headed. For occasional use, it is better than the alternative, though I'm not sure I believe the time-release is worth the cost. Next time I'll try the generic. The treatment details? I like to have it on hand, but not to use unless I can't get to sleep any other way. Often, I go to sleep easily enough, but wake in the middle of the night. If it's 2-3am, I will take one, and might be groggy in the morning, but I function better than if I couldn't go back to sleep. If it's after 3:20am, I haven't tried it yet, because I get up early."
3583,"Texture of the skin has improved a lot by regularly going for peel sessions and by using the prescribed drugs which has to be used through out the treatment period. The negative side is controlling acne during the treatment period is little tough as new skin appears , so one has to keep his face clean by having lots of water and constantly washing the face with the face wash solution prescribed. The treatment is to improve the skin texture,complexion by constantly going for peels and derma-rollers once in 15days.The above mentioned medicine is prescribed to be used through out the treatment period."
3005,"I had a kidney infection with a very high fever.  Cipro reduced the fever from 104.2 to 97.6 within 5 or 6 day/cured the kidney infection.. I threw up the first dose, which was two tablets,approximately one hour after taking it.  I also experienced headaches for one to two hours after taking the cipro  for first few days.  Other than that, I just kept getting better, day by day. I took 2 tablets, then I took 1 tablet twice a day after eating.  I also drank lots and lots of water and cranberry juice. After approx. 5 days, I no longer had side effects and the fever was gone.  I actually felt perfectly fine after about 6 days or so."
4117,"decreased smoking and the desire to smoke somewhat,  could not get any buzz off of nicotine vety nervous, weird dreams, I discontinued after awhile because I wanted my smoking buzz and not to feel weird and nervous all day. followed manufactures program, which was a titrated increase over several days."
2671,"It did lower my BP some I'm not sure if the drugs did this, but I have severe tinnitus now, and it's driving me crazy! I definitely have to have synthroid, because once I stopped taking it, and I couldn't get out of bed I was so tired. I have not stopped the lisinopril, continue to take it with no side effects, except I wonder about the ear ringing."
2393,with the treatment I feel less tired and more energetic.I comeback to my normal weight and I stop losing my hair. Also I do not get cold as I use to. I did not have any side effects after the doctor find the right dosage I was able to function like I used to before I have the symptoms of the hypothyroid. I take one tablet everyday in the morning in a empty stomach around the same time and I wait an hour before I eat. Sometimes I can only wait 30 minutes and it does not seems to alter the effect of the medication.
2132,I was able to concentrate and complete daily tasks.  I didn't have to write notes to myself and constantly put them in various places so I would run into during the day.l I get a bit irritable when the medication wears off for about 30 minutes.  I also feel quite tired during this time. My primary care physician prescribe it after telling him my problems I've had my entire life in concentrating/completing tasks.  I was also very forgetful but don't have any of these problems except on occasion when I have too many things going on.
1186,"Maintained a general feeling of well being and being able to cope with life. When I stopped the treatment (gradually) the depression returned after a couple of months. Having suffered from depression periodically over a number of years, I feel my quality of life has increased with Prozac. None One 20 mg tablet once a day, in the morning."
2942,"I had been to several doctors regarding pain in my thigh mostly.  I had seen Orthopedic Dr, Family practice (2), Endocrinologist and finally Nuerologist, who prescribed the Mirapex.  I did note slight improvement in leg pain however the weight gain issue was totally unacceptable to me and the benefit was only slight.  I have had much better results with Lyrica. Basically, I only noticed a huge weight gain of approximately 15 pounds.  I do not really recall any further side effects.  There were however, other side effects listed on the prescription contraindication form.  I do not recall what the side effects listed on that form were now. he Doctor told me to take  he medication at bed time each evening. she also suggested that I might find it useful to sleep with a contour pillow between my thighs.  She said to get up and walk around rather than lie in bed tossing if I could not sleep.  As for the weight gain, it was recommended that I try to excercise more and reduce caloric intake."

2305,"more relaxed and not so obsessive, i did not hit lows or find myself depressed but more level and even loose bowels. some say i was not as much fun or as joyful as i was beforede the drug so i believe it may have numbed my emotions a bit/ I was given this drug b/c of feelings of sadness and loss of organizational skills and not as hopeful or positive of the future as i had been, i had taken prozac years ago and was off it for 5 years b/f i tried this . i am not on any anti-depresant at the time."
346,"The benefits are that being on Neurontin with the Lidoderm Patch 5%, it has helped to give me a much better quality of life.  My pain is significantly reduced because of these two medications, though not completely gone.  The side effects, to my knowledge, have been minimal, especially compared to what it could be without these medications.  Could a different medication work better?  Maybe. It's hard to say what the side effects might be.  I sometimes have trouble thinking or speaking my thoughts concisely, moodiness, somewhat depressed, shortness of breath at times, dizziness, occasional vision problems, some numbness or odd sensations in legs or arms etc.  However, I can't say for sure if any of these side effects/symptoms are from taking Neurontin, the lidoderm patch or for some other reason (stresses...). Ten years ago I had spinal chord surgery to remove a tumor.  Fortunately it was benign.  The down side is that it pressed on the nerves so much that it permanently damaged them.  The greatest nerve pain I have is from the center of my chest all the way around on the right side (breast area) to the center of my back on the right.  The skin in that area is so sensitive that any clothing even slightly rubbing on it can cause great pain.  I have been very happy with Neurotin for the most part.  I know it is working because if I am late taking my next dose (every eight hours) the pain starts to increases.  The Neurotin alone does not work well.  In addition, I have to wear a Lidoderm patch.  This has made a huge difference.  Now, after nine years I'm beginning to feel my medication isn't working as well as it used to and am planning to review these changes with my doctor."

877,"I was able to go about my daily life without feeling fear and paranoia. I was also able to handle a significant amount of stress in a reasonable manner. I was very tired, having to nap daily. Also missing a dose or forgetting to take it about the same time daily caused withdrawl syptoms of nausea and extreme dizziness. Take one pill daily, visit with a physciatrist monthly, and some therapy sessions."
2057,"This is a miracle drug. By day 3, the hot flashes stopped. I was able to sleep through the night again. The 2 month long headache disappeared. I have more energy and feel like my old self again. My brain function is much improved. No more dizziness, memory loss and the depression is gone. Also I have an increased libido and vaginal moisture returned. Slight swelling of my breasts. I went to my doctor for severe headaches, hot flashes and sleep disturbance as well as fatigue. He took a FSH bloodtest and it revealed I was in menopause. He prescribed Prempro and everything was right again."

Also negative as it was given as a long term pain management solution, it reduced my pain but still needed to be used along-side pain-killers.  If stopping and has been taken for a long time slowly ween off (unlike myself) as caused me to have sweats, aches and pains and lethargy (flu-like symptoms) for a number of days. 50 mg at bedtime."
2150,"This medicine stopped post nasal drip, itching throat, eyes, and nose. There were no treatment side effects noted. I have taken this medicine once daily, in the morning for at least 5 years.  It has been very helpful and does not make me sleepy.  It does not, however, last the 24 hours claimed, which is why I also take benadryl at night to manage allergy symptoms at night."
3240,"I had lighter periods and never felt the ring inside of me during intercourse or during my every day life. Vaginal irritation, decreased sexual desire, constant yeast infections Within the first two weeks that I started using Nuvaring my sexual desire decreased and it became very difficult to get aroused.  This had never happened to me before and as soon as I stopped using the ring it became easier to get aroused.  I also had constant yeast infections while taking this drug.  Before I started Nuvaring I had never in my life had one.  While on it, I must have had at least six.  I have been off of the ring now for three months and have not had one.  Although I have seen few people make this claim, I swear that there is a connection."
3114,"Benefits were the prevention of pregnancy, regular periods, shorter periods, and less intense pms symptoms.  My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period. For the first month of taking ortho tri cyclen i was a little moody.  When my period started the first month i was very moody but that only lasted about 3 days.  The second month of my period my pms calmed down and now i have no mood swings and only one day of cramps. I take the sunday start pills everyday in the afternoon."
2268,"Lexapro worked very well to make me feel better, less anxious and unhappy. I gained ten pounds in the few months that I took this medicine. I've taken several anti-depressants over the years trying to find something with the least side effects for me. Paxil caused my jaw to always clench, Prozac caused heart flutters.

My doctor was very insistant that Lexapro was not the cause of my weight gain. However, I insisted on trying something else (Wellbutrin). Within 2 months I had lost the aberrant 10 pounds."
486,"I lost 90 pounds in 6 months. The key was drinking water all throughout the day. I ate 1 meal a day before 6pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce, fruit cups, canned fruit,etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food, icecream, chips or any other food that is unhealthy). I saw no results in the first month, but once 30 days had passed, I started to lose 1 lb. a day & sometimes 1 1'2 lb. a day. Even after getting off of Meridia, I still continued to lose weight 2 months later. Product was VERY expensive but worth it! The more weight you have to lose the more you WILL lose! Insomnia sometimes. My bedtime(before Meridia) was around 10pm but once I began taking the medicine, I couldn't sleep sometimes until 12am or 1am, but even with lack of sleep, I never felt fatigued like I thought I would. Every once in a while, mild headaches & dry mouth. But nothing too major or life-threatening. Lost 91 lbs. in 6-7 months. Kept the weight off even to this day (4 years later) b/c the Meridia taught me the key to weight loss: Less calorie intake. And since the Meridia trained my body to get full quicker, I was able to still eat & crave less even after getting off of the medication."
1288,"Taking this medication twice a day has kept my blood pressure within the ""normal"" range; even though I am over-weight. I do exercise everyday, although very minimally. I think it is just the medication that is keeping my blook pressure so low. Sometimes, I feel a bit of light-headedness and dizzy. Sometimes sleepy. Although it is hard to tell if this is just from the medication or some other reason. But overall I am happy with the medication and plan on continuing to take it as long as I need to. Before I started taking the medication, my blood pressure was extremely high. I didn't exercise much and I am was over weight. At my doctor's orders, I began taking the medication and it took a while to take effect, but when it did, it has and still continues to keep my blood pressure within the normal range. I continue to be over-weight, and I only exercise minimally, but everyday."
2709,"My overall mood, sense of well being, energy level was increased with better sleep pattern restored. I also noted improvement in my facial firmness and skin tone. No side effects of any kind were noted or apparent from the use of this product. I have used bioidentical estrogen hormone Divigel for 2 years plus and plan to continue. Divigel is a topically applied Bio-Identical Hormone ( Estrogen) which I Highly Recommended. The product is applied topically at night to top of (leg) thigh. My benefits were improved mood, clarity of thought, increased energy, better sustained sleep, and mproved skin firmness and tone - even facial skin."

The sinus headache, nausea, and anxiety were immediate, but flu like symptoms and lesions didn't appear until start of 3rd week. I then stopped taking Oracea. It made me feel like my body was falling apart, the back pain, nausea, and flu like symptoms weren't worth having an acne-free face. I took one pill per day for 2-3 weeks."
2877,A considerable decline in the occurrence of new spots accompanied treatment. The acne has been practically eliminated if a good cleansing routine is maintained. Red marks have faded. Blackheads have cleared up. The overall result is clearer and smoother skin. Occasional mild skin irritation particularly in the beginning of treatment. Applied a small amount to the face once daily in the afternoon. Applied sunscreen during the day to compensated for the increase in photosensitivity
3991,"in theory, my bones should have gotten stronger, as measured by the bone scan done at my gynecologist office once every 18 months I first tried the tablets and they would sit on my stomach as if I had a brick for breakfast. So I tried the oral solution which, in fact, was better on the stomach but,still, not completely without side effects. Most of the days I took Fosamax I had a slight stomach discomfort during the morning. I took Fosamax for almost 4 years and after 2 bone density scans which showed no improvement  I decided to stop the treatment, against my doctor advice which was to take Fosamax for at least 5 years. I believe that we still do not know enough about how the bone keeps itself healthy and that bone scans are not yet reliable. It's a big business and I finally refused to keep a medication that is so hard on the digestive system and can also have very dangerous side effects (frozen bones, I believe it is called). I still have to be convinced that a low density bone is not necessarily stronger than a bone with more density. Waiting for more research I am trying to walk as much as possible and to follow a reasonable diet. And to be at peace with myself...  Thanks!"
1035,"Lasted all day long, could put it in a drink, insomnia, and irritability Compared to other ADD meds I tried, Vyvanse seemed to be the only one that didn't interact with the Prozac. Also, I think finding the right dose had a lot to do with that.  Because I could easily split the pills I was able to take a larger dose in the morning and a lesser mid-morning and not have a big drop at the end of the day."

Regardless there is still some mild irritation in my esophagus. Nothing noticeable.  Soluble tablet has a slightly unpleasant aftertaste.  Unknown if my vitamin B12 levels have been affected. Will likely be on Prevacid indefinitely due to GERD unless I have Nissen fundoplication surgery, and perhaps even still then.

When I started using this drug, I was given a 50mg dose hs.  I developed a tolerance and the dose needed to be increased until it reached 300mg. I was refered to a pharmacology specialist to see how I could be weaned off such a large dose in order to help control my weight because of the triggering of the carbohydrate cravings for which elavil is well known for.  I have partiall been switched to topamax( 150mg hs with 225mg elavil hs) and I almost immediately lost 15lbs)"
3584,"I can't really say that the benefits were incredibly impressive. The topical treatment was used along side of an antibiotic for a series of weeks.(4-6) The acne condition improved, but never completely. Eventually, after a couple more scattered, severe breakouts in the following years; the acne went away. The side effects were dry, tender, itchy skin. Lotion and Sunblock were very necessary. One dime size topical application once every night before bed. This was alternated every other night with a topical retinol cream and combined with an antibiotic pill that was taken daily with a meal."

1662,"no positive benefits mood changes, weight gain (4 pounds in 3 days!) extremely emotional. depression I had been using the trade brand of this patch, Climara for several months with positive results.  One month my local pharmacy was out of the trade brand and offered to fill the prescription with the generic brand and because I was in a hurry to catch a plane to go on a vacation, I agreed, thinking they had to be similar.  Wrong!  To begin with, the generic patch is twice the size and thickness of the trade brand - don't even think of wearing tight clothes while sporting one of these!  (I laughlingly told my husband we could always use one to patch a flat tire if needed, but soon it wasn't so funny.)  Within a day or two I knew something was wrong, but hadn't yet identified the problem.  I couldn't stop crying about nothing in particular.  It seemed as if overnight, my world had become very sad and depressing. I immediately began to gain weight, despite no change in my dietary habits.  After finally putting two and two together, I ripped it off and contacted my local pharmacist to see if anyone else had complained of similar experiences.  After rechecking my prescription, the pharmacist noticed my physician had marked ""no generics"".  Apparently, he had a good reason for this choice as this was not his usual stance on generics.  The pharmacist refilled my prescription with the trade brand and all was quickly back to normal. I usually have no problem with genereic brands, but unfortunately, no more generic estradiol for me!"

My doctor was NOT aware of this as a side effect of Prosac, and sent me to another doctor for an additonal consultation before he would change the medication. 
Now I believe the side effects are more well-known. I suffered from depression after my mother committed suicide, and I sought treatment. I was given prozac, and no other treatment. I did research on treatment for depression and after suffering side effects from Prozac, I began using exercize to treat my depression. It works very well."
3189,"less depression and suicidal ideation. I was not responding to any other anti-depressants and this one sometimes works for people who do not respond to others. Maybe it's because it makes you sleep very well. Sometimes it is prescribed as a mild sleeping pill. sleepiness, it must be taken at bedtime. and some memory loss. a bit of blurred vision. If there is no food in the stomach there can be nausea. If I get up in the middle of the night I sometimes vomit. I must take it daily and can not just quit suddenly. I must phase off if necessary."

I had been taking Prozac with other medications for 10 years and it had stopped working for me.  After being prescribed Wellbutrin with it, I found I felt so much better.  However, when I tried to stop taking Prozac entirely and stay just on the Wellbutrin, my depression returned.  I have been on this cocktail now for 5 years and believe it has helped me immensly."
707,"I had cystic acne, however within the first month i the acne reduced significantly! By the time i was at the 6 month point i had no acne at all. The only down side were the side effects... i felt joint pain, extreme dryness- esp my lips, very dry eyes. I was uncomfortable, however i have been 1 1/2 year without it and i barely get a little zit anymore. pain, extreme dryness- esp my lips, very dry eyes. There is a great deal of monitoring with this drug... so you really have to be committed to using it (i.e., blood work, frequent dermatology visits, one month waiting period for women to be sure you get on oral birth control, monthly phone questionnaire with the company). I began the medication at a dose of 30 mg once daily and it was increased to 60 mg... which became the maximum i could handle without significant discomfort."
589,"During the ten years I've been taking acyclovir, I have experienced zero outbreaks, compared to almost continuous outbreaks prior to taking this drug. I occasionally have the achiness that precedes an outbreak, and have on two or three occasions taken an extra dose per day when I experience that symptom. I have experienced no noticeable side effects during this ten year period on acyclovir. I have no special treatment details except taking recommended dose on time and not skipping doses."
3184,"I slept well, except that was not my problem. I was forced to miss work due to a very deep sleep. I took this ONCE, upon the reccomendation of a doctor. I soon became very dizzy and was forced to go to sleep. When it was time to wake up, I couldn't. Finally I did, but with an annoying headache. Later in the day, I got a chest pain.

1345,"The treatment benefits were that my cholestrol levels went from 9 to the 4-5 level.  This was demonstrated by regular blood test results. The only side effect occured in the first 3 months, where slight aching of the joints and muscles was experienced.  This disappeared after 3 months. A pill is taken every night before going to bed."

1902,"Cleared up my Acne Vulgaris (acne turned into a big boil) and also coincidentally helped manage my lung condition. Usually I take ciprofloxacin 750mg twice a day, two weeks on and two weeks off for my CF, in addition to Azithromycin 250mg every day..BUT when I am off the Cipro i find that my lung condition very gradually deteriorates when I am not on Cipro. My finding was that when I was off the Cipro, and on the Doxycycline, the Doxycycline happen to help ""maintain""or slow down the exacerbation of my lung condition. YES. Besides being more suceptable to sunburn, being in a tropical climate i felt I was VERY much more suceptable to heat exhaustion symptoms. I overcame this by taking double dosage of Salt tablets, and wearing a wet/cool towel around my neck to prevent the sun exposure on back of my neck. Wore a hat at all times also. Doxycycline 100mg twice a day, after meals, with no milk for 1 mour before or after. To helpe with side effects I took 16-22 salt tablets per day (being in a tropical climate) plus panadol 2 tablets twice a day after meals. I found the panadol helped manage the symptoms of vertigo (mild dizzyness). I felt the panadol in low dosages also helped me recover quicker from excercise."
2698,"For the most part, the pressure feeling I constantly had in my bladder went away.  Sometimes, especially in the middle of the night, the pressure would return slightly.  Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night, I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night. I would wake up with a very hoarse voice.  Usually, the hoarsness would disappear during the day, but sometimes my voice would crack when I spoke.  Also, your throat is dry and irratated.  It's almost like you feel like you're getting a bad sore throat but it never quite turns into one.  My mouth was a little dry, but hardly noticable. I was prescribed it after a bladder infection, which was cleared up, lead to a pressure feeling in my bladder.  I take the medicine once a day.  I guess the medicine is slow releasing but once in a while I felt like I should take a dose earlier than prescribed.  I am also scheduled for physical therapy on the muscles of my bladder wall, but have not started them yet.  I did this kind of therapy 10 years ago when my bladder had this same pressure feeling and the therapy did help--I'm looking forward to starting it and hopefully getting off the medication."
904,"My anxiety when driving was lowered. None One day I was driving on a freeway (280, San Francisco Bay area) and felt like I was going to faint.  It was a clear day, not much traffic as it was the middle of the day and this freeway is more of a 'country' freeway than our main one, 101.  I pulled over to the shoulder so I could compose myself.  I felt like I was having a panic attack (which I had never had before but friends have) so I took deep, slow breaths to calm myself.  When I felt I was alright, I returned to the freeway but had to pull over once more before I reached home.  I have never been in an accident nor had this feeling before so could not rationalize what was happening. After it happened a few more times, I put paper bags in my car (for breathing) and started using side roads, where I had no problems.  When I went to my doctor, I told him about my anxiety and he prescribed Paxil for me.  I began taking it and, it took a while, though I wasn't ready to try the freeway right away, but it has definitely helped. I am now more willing to just get on the freeway.  I have not noticed any side effects from taking it or changes in my personality...I did not need it for depression or any other anxiety but freeway driving."

1198,"The combination of the two drugs helped me cope with my pain and depression, which seem to be related.  I'm able to cope with most of life's difficulties and am not sleeping as much.  With the vicodin helping with the pain, when I do sleep I find it's much more restful and satisfying.  I still have a long way to go and I believe that I will need to take these two drugs for a while as I tried quitting the prozac and immediately resumed the depression. A little more sleepy and lack energy.  Also, it's obvious with the prozac that I'm at a point that I'm not able to go off of it without replacing it with something.  The vicodin doesn't seem to be a problem with side effects as long as I don't take more than one tablet at a time (500/5). I've had depression and pain for some time.  They have both caused serious problems in my life.  I found myself isolated and sleeping far too much.  I did some research and found that lack of seritonin could cause an increse sensitivity to pain so I was hoping that my pain would subside with this treatment.  So far, I can't tell the difference.  My doctor seems to be concerned about taking the vicodin but I'm more concerned about the long term effects of the prozac.  Only time will tell."

2307,"Deppression disappeared. Anxiety disappeared. Since I have been on Lexapro I have realised I have been depressed most of my life. I have a very strong family history of major depression. I was in denial to the fact I was depressed. When you have always been depressed you don't know any different. Since Lexapro I have felt alot calmer and happier. The intense guilt I felt about everything has almost gone. My mind would also constantly relieve traumatic past events and mistakes I had made. I really didn't ever want to wake up in the morning - but now I do. The depressive need to sleep in the day time has gone. I am also becoming much less socially isolated, more confident and have began ejoying life. I would have liked to find Lexapro Many years ago. I started taking 5mg daily for the first two weeks and did feel an increase in anxiety which subsided after a couple of days. When I increased to 10 mg the anxiety returned and then again subsided. I also felt ""far away and fuzzzy headed"" for about 3 weeks. Insomnia was also an initial side effect. After 6 weeks I am not experiencing any side effects and am extremely grateful for my improved mood. I began taking Lexapro for 6 weeks. I started at 5mg for two weeks and then increased it to 10mg. I plan to continue taking it for a long time as i have never felt better."
3651,"I really did not experience any benefits. Skin redness, flaking, photosensitivity, and irritation. Soon after beginning treatment as directed, I began experiencing the negative side effects. I kept with the treatment for maybe 1-2 months, and then could no longer tolerate the appearance and feel of my skin. It seemed like I was more self-conscious of the side effects than I had been of the acne and breakouts (which were still present anyway)."
1756,"My headaches were not as severe as they were before I started the medication but I still had headaches, just not as many and not as severe. I had no appetite which caused me to lose 10 pounds in a month. Also not having an appetite made me not eat enough, so I would get more headaches because I wasn't eating enough. I also felt very depressed on this medication. During the time I was on topamax I slept a lot and didn't eat enough, I didn't feel like I was myself. I took 25 mg for two weeks at night, then 50 mg for the next two weeks, then 75 mg for the next two then I went down to 50 mg for three days then to 25 mg for three days and I have discontinued the medication."

I noticed a significant increase in irritability...I felt like I was in PMS all the time.  This affected my marriage.  I went to my family physician  knowing that this was probably due to onset of menopause.  It took about a month for the symptoms to abate.  I stayed on Prompro for ten years.  I stopped taking Prempro one month ago, mainly due to evidence of direct correlations between HRT use and increasing probability of breast cancer occurence.  I am now concerned over decreasing health of my skin because I am no longer on HRT."

1696,I saw measurable difference in reduction of blackheads and pore size. I was also really happy with the evening of pigmentation. I had sun and age spots as well as freckling and  saw a huge difference in the lightening of all these problems.  My skin had a much better over all tone a seemed to become firmer over time. The first few weeks of treatment my skin was peeling a little and I had some red splotches but eventually these symptoms went away. I would wash my face in the evening with a mild cleanser and then every other night when my face was completely dry I would apply a small amount of Retin-A to my face with the exception of the immediate eye area. The evenings that I did not use Retin-A I would use a good night moisturizer.

Perhaps after the 1st week I thought my hair loss increased, then it's like the hair that remained all strengthened, and then, the small hairs that shed started up new growth. I did not notice any viable new growth at the temple region, but the vertex and high forehead areas seem to be thicker and younger and better hairs then I had 6 months ago. 

I look forward to a 2 year review! I've noticed an increase in sexual desire over this period. I find that I need to have sex at least daily, and or masturbate at least once a day to simply feel relieved and sexually relaxed. My doctor has reported that she has seen this reported more often then the 'common' side effects reported. 

In addition to my findings I find my Semen while in greater quantity during orgasm seems to be thinner after ejaculation. Took one pill orally in 1mg form, generic - daily for 6 months. (Am still taking....) 

At the 6 month mark I've certainly not lost more, the hair looks thicker, and longer. 

I do need to admit that I'm also using Nisim shampoo. Which has a clinical study reported to be successful. While it only has one ingredient which is thought to regrow hair, Saw palmetto , it's clinical trial after 5 months saw over 80 percent of men regrow hair. It's a stimulant that appears to work, while the shampoo appears to thicken hair. I think it is working in conjunction with propecia to restore my hair."

2601,"None... did not make my periods any lighter Weight gain... I gained 10-15 pounds while on the pill and because I'm only 4'10, that 10-15 pounds REALLY SHOWS. I've tried other oral contraceptives for my heavy menstrual bleeding and all of them do the same thing... they don't help regulate my menstrual bleeding but they do make me gain weight. In the future, when I need to use a method of birth control, I will not be using oral contraceptives... EVER! My sister is also on this pill (for birth control) and she has experienced many side affects from it, too."
1730,"Once I started using the inhaler it greatly reduced night time waking with asthma symptoms. Early morning breathing became easier instead of tight breathing.  My use of a rescue inhaler specifically, Proventil, was cut down from several times a night to usually 0. I only use my rescue inhaler occassionally now instead of routinely.  My life has changed with Advair, I highly recommend it! When I first started it, I noticed a little bit of nervousness, this only lasted a few days, and with continued use, I am no longer having any side effects.  I have never experienced any of the lung infections the package insert speaks of, nor have I ever had sudden asthma symptoms after using the Advair Inhaler. One inhalation of the Advair Inhaler in the morning and one again at bedtime."
2902,"reduction of itching which was caused by seasonal allergies.  Itching was primarily on skin around elbows and also sinus congestion.

1131,"the benefits weren't noticed per needed. I couldn't tell if the back spine was stronger as I felt the same. My gums really dried out and were sore and red, I had to have special treatment from a specialist for gum disease and scaling. He said it was the same as leaving a steak out of the refrigerator for a few days. Before that, my gums were in good shape! dental specialist went under gums to deep clean and I had to have special care.  also, some teeth moved inward. This changed my teeth's ositions and now don't look as nice."
1814,"I was initially placed on this medication several years ago for RA when Vioxx was pulled.  I religiously self administered the medication for two years and then decided to quit because I didn't believe that it was helping much.  I took a ""holiday"" for 16 months and then checked in with my rheumatologist.  She suggested that I restart the medicine based upon x-rays and blood work.  I have been on it again for 3mos...I feel better...less pain..more energy. I have not experienced any side effects. I am fortunate that I have good insurance coverage because it is very expensive. As with any medicine...I am concerned about possible long term side effects.  However...my grandmother had RA and was severely crippled with the disease.  This medication is supposed to prevent joint destruction...I am hoping that it will."
455,"The treatment benefits of QVAR are that I do not think about my condition. Also, it is easy to execute the treatment.  I exercise and go about my day as if I were not afflicted with asthma.  I do not worry about having an attack, which is a big relief.  The treatment is inconspicuous, another plus. I am fortunate in saying that there are no side effects at the dose I am taking. Each morning, I take out my AeroChamber that holds the QVAR.  I shake the QVAR aerosol canister and place it back into the AeroChamber.  I then empty my lungs of air and take a big puff of the QVAR. I hold it in my lungs for as long as possible before breathing out.  I repeat this process at night before retiring. I expect to be using QVAR for the foreseeable future."

The abdominal pain increased in severity over several days, starting in lower GI and moving up to include mid and upper abdomen.  The drug was stopped for a few weeks.

Drug discontinued. stopped drug.  rechallenged few weeks later with same results"
233,The drug caused the depression to recede to the point that I was able to function normally. The libido lowering effects of a prior antidepressent (SSRI) were alleviated completely. I was able to lose excess weight gained during treatment with the other SSRI Occasionally I would have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep if I took the drug too late in the day. I began to take it upon wakening daily to counter those effects. I took one tablet per day 300 mg of the Wellbutrin XL.

Social relationships with co-workers and others were markedly improved. Social relationships with extended family members were also improved. As a result there was a marked improvement in self esteem and confidence levels both at work and at home. There wer few side effects.  I experienced intermittent episodes of dry mouth that interferes when during public speaking, speaking at meetings and in social situations.  This can be resolved with small candies, however, that resulted in tooth decay.  I am currently trying out a gel and mouthwash given to me by my dentist, however, I am not happy about putting these chemicals in my mouth. I am not sure what you want in this section.  I received counseling.  Medication was suggested.  Other more typical, stimulant  medications were tried but produced anxiety.  This is a newer non-stimulant medication, and that is a plus. I have continued counseling and periodic check-ups with the prescribing physician.  I am pleased with the results and plan on continuing with this treatment."

3806,"Long lasting erection achy joints similar to flu symptoms during the next couple of days after taking. Not bad, but definitely annoying. Aspirin helps relieve, but I did not like having to take a pill to counteract another pill.  I do not have the same symptom with Viagra. Taken as needed for ED.  It is effective in as little as 30 minutes.  Time depends if taken on empty stomach or after a meal."
3300,"I was having difficulty controlling my temper, having loss of motivation, anxiety.  This helped to take the edge off so that I could function without the extreme mood swings. I didn't notice any side effects except that it seemed to mess with weight loss.  Going off the medication for the periods indicated by my dr seemed to help. I was advised to take the medication daily for the week leading to my period starting.  My dr said that through trial and error I would find the best treatment plan.  Turns out I usually take it everyday except for the first day of my period and 3 - 5 days after that.  I was also advised to take 20 minute daily walk in the sun."
392,"Decreased blood pressure, decreased cardiac load, decreased kidney load Increased urine output, potassium deficit Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed by my doctor as a first line treatment of my mild hypertension (140/90).

542,"Trazodone seems to help me to fall asleep faster and sleep longer. I had been having a hard time getting to sleep at night with insomia type effects. I would toss and turn and would have a hard time relaxing and would think about things that would make it hard for me to fall asleep. I started out at 200 mg, which would make me drozy in the mornings, and then changed to 100 mg which enabled me to get to sleep and not have such a side effect. At first some drozyness in the morning when taking 200mg, then after lowering the dose to 100 mg., the side effects seemed to subside. I have not noticed any side effects since then except that if I do not have the drug, I will have an extremely hard time getting asleep. I take 100 mg. each night when I go to bed. I take this drug seven days a week."

When the progestins were increased, the bleeding tapered off but insomnia became a major issue.  Some increased fluid retention in the hands and feet. Breast tenderness. Patient began to experience menopausal symptoms in early 40s.  Prempro was prescribed by physician to treat hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and signs of early vaginal atrophy.  When heavy vaginal bleeding continued to be problematic, hgher doses of progestins were tried.  The result was increasing severity of the sleep disturbances although the vaginal bleeding subsided.

Patient later developed bladder cancer, although no familial or behavioral risk factors were present."

Mild occasional insomnia Taken once a day it acts as a mood lifter and helps you feel full with less food.  It helped me take off a few pounds.  However, it is only a tool and patient has to be diligent about monitoring hunger and deciding to limit portions.  It's easy to ""eat around"" the drug and overeat. For short term weight loss or to help lose 10 -15 lbs it is great. VERY expensive...$125 for one months supply."

The doctors told me to come off them straight away. I contacted the makers and they too advised me to stay off them. If not for Swollen and sore breasts, I would have continued the use. My breasts returned to normal size, no pain. If you have gynacomastia, be very careful....Thankyou. Lee."

Weight gain, loss of interest in creative activities, loss of interest in sex, loss of interest in work, inability to work, inability to feel or think or behave beyond the very basic requirements of living.

While the side effects that I experienced were annoying, they did not negate the benefits of taking the medicine. It made all of my allergy symptoms disappear (itchy eyes, hayfever, nasal congestion etc)  The side effects were extreme cotton mouth, and I mean extreme. It also very much interrupted a restful night sleep.  However, as annoying as these are, it was worth it to have the affect of the drug itself in dealing with seasonal allergies.

My family doctor prescribed naproxen for continued inflamation and soreness after I had completed a 3 month period of physical therapy for my separated shoulder.  I had been using ibuprofen and/or tylenol and my discomfort had continued unabatted.  I was given a prescription for naproxen, 375mg, to be taken as needed twice daily.

So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a ""treatment for the symptoms"". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life. Constipation, dry mouth and some mild dizziness that would go away after medication was stopped for a few days. I was given Prilosec prescription at a dose of 45mg per day. Medication was taken once, every morning before eating. Each treatment duration was for 6 months."

It made me very, very tired, so I take it before bed and sleep wonderfully. With 40mg dosage - increased sweating, faintness, nearly passing out. I started with the 20mg dosage and it seemed to be working pretty well until about a month in when I had a bad anxiety attack.  After seeing the doctor, she upped me to 40mg.  After one dosage of 40mg, I nearly passed out twice and started profusely sweating.  My hearing also went all funny.  The doctor advised me to drop back down to 20mg and then try to go back up to the 40mg.  Emotionally, I felt better after the 40mg, even after nearly fainting, but the side effects were very bad."
860,"It was beneficial for alleviating nervousness and feelings of anxiety. I took one half tablet or a full tablet depending upon how anxious or nervous I was feeling. If particularly anxious/nervous sometimes I took one tablet plus a half. I didn't take this medication on a daily basis, but only when I was going to be involved in a nerve wracking experience. Only mild slightly woozy feelings. Exacerbated when I took higher dose of 1 & 1/2 tablets This medication was prescribed to calm feelings of anxiety and nervousness that I experienced in certain social situations."

Unfortunately, it seems like my nail isn't growing, which is why I'm afraid if I remove the nail (with a podiatrist) that it may not grow back-my dermatologist agrees I should not have the nail removed; she wants me to live with it. She says that even with Lamasil and all that expense and liver damaging drug, the fungus can still come back in 2 months."
1215,"Patient expressed decrease in compulsory acts and a general improvement in mental stability. Also to note, patient showed a general improvement in social and educational functions as expressed in an academic report. Increased insomnia with a decrease in appetite, as common with this medication. The patient was asked to participate in active counseling in addition to the medication. Some of the compulsions appear to correlate to stress induced anxiety, so the patient was urged to stop, breathe, relax, before attempting a stressful (or habitual) activity.  I also found it necessary to inform the patient of the current paradigm on his condition as well as offer alternative treatments."

Several years ago a new doctor wanted to change me to Trileptal.  The experience was not good - a major seizure while he was experimenting with the dosage; dizzy spells came over me in the morning, sometimes during my commute.  Later the doctor switched to Lamictal.  I have been on Lamictal for several years now with no seizures and no side effects, with the occasional 'aura' (something like a headache that in the past has sometimes been a precursor to a seizure).
I do not know the efectiveness of the new generic equivalent."

I didnt have a significant improvement in the fine lines. I am attributing this because they are expression lines under my eyes. drying and peeling. I used it every other night as instructed. Sometimes during the weekends I didnt apply for 2 days in a row, to let my skin rest and to use other moisturizing. products. Your skin definitely gets used to renova over time.

2237,"Treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, itchy ears, itchy throat, sneezing, nasal drip, congestion and borderline asthma; however, during high allergy season, the regular dosage was insufficient, the beneficial effects lasting only about 12 hours, instead of the intended 24.  Then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above. Increasing the dosage to twice daily during high allergy season resulted in horrible side effects such as severe headache, nervousness, heart palpitations, dizziness, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the loss of appetite. I had to stop taking it altogether for four to five days, before I felt comfortable in taking it again.  Now I take only one/day regardless of the extent of allergies. Treatment details included, at first, a dosage first thing every morning, around 6am. During moderate allergy season, this lasted me until the following morning, but as soon as I got up at 6, symptoms came on full strength.  The Allegra did not take effect for an hour and a half.  So I started waking up at 5 to take it then, so that as I prepared for work I was able to do so without runny eyes, nose, etc.  But during the heavy allergy season (dogwood), I would take one at 5am and one at 6pm.  Within two weeks the side effects had me back to my regular dosage."

I want to commend HerpesFish.com for giving people like us a platform to share or stories with people living with the same conditions."
2532,"I did not see a change in the condition of the toenail. Only about a quarter if the left great toenail was affected. After taking the drug for the 12 weeks, the physician recommended another 12 week course, however my insurance company would not cover the extended treatment and I could not afford the cost of Lamisil. Perhaps a positive effect would have been realized if I was able to continue the treatment none I was to take the drug for 12 weeks after having liver function studies performed. I did not experience any untowards side effects having taken the medication for ther prescribed 12 weeks. I did not miss any doses during that time."

I entered a hospuital six years ago for suicidality; I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating (I had anorexia nervosa), and I was extremely depressed. I started taking 10mg of Zyprexa the first night I was there. I was really drowsy all the next day, but it waned over a few days (now it doesn't affect my energy level at all.) In about a week, my depression just lifted. This medicine has worked miracles for me- I've been depression-free since starting it- and I wouldn't go off it for any reason."
2396,"The treatment benefits of taking Synthroid have everything to do with metabolism regulation.  Because I had thyroid cancer the entire thyroid was removed.  Since thyroid hormone keeps the body running at optimum speed, it is now essential for me to take medication that will accomplish what my body is no longer capable of doing on its own. There have been no treatment side effects for me thus far. Treatment consists simply of taking a 100 mcg Synthroid pill each morning.  This should be taken on an empty stomach and no food should be taken for one full hour.  It is also important not to take any calcium supplement for four hours after taking Synthroid.  Calcium interferes with the body's ability to effectively utilize the Synthroid."

But later is better than never, I am very grateful this drug exists.  It is not an amphetamine (which is good because I could get addicted to speed too easily), this does not amp me up, it makes me calm and inspired and focused, a HUGE change in my life.  I am actually enjoying being alive (which is saying a lot compared to where I was at before taking Ritalin) absolutely none. I started with 2.5 mg 3x a day and gradually increased the dosage, then to 5mg 3 x a day and now I am doing the best at 10 mg. 3 x a day.  I will stay here at 30mg. total for the day.

Some temporary (fortuantely) arthritic conditions in a finger and thumb.
Hastened osteoporosis.  That is my bone desity decreased severely after 2 1/2 years. I take one tiny pill each morning with the vitamins that I take.   There is no nausea or other immediate symptoms.  It is simple to do."

All side effects mild and transient. Treatment once a day at night. Evidence suggests that glucophage/metformin mimics the biological effect of calorie restriction for life extension.
832,"Acid in the stomach was reduced so that the reflux was kept under control.  Therefore there was little of no chance of irritation of the esophagus. Constipation and even less chance of digesting food properly. Even though the reflux was kept under control I felt that constipation and poor digestion was a bad trade-off.  As there is bowel cancer in the family clearing of the large intestine is important to me.  I have now stopped taking the drug and prefer to treat the reflux by taking care of what I eat, how and when I eat, and being careful not to bend over too much after food.  I also use ginger tea which helps to regulate the stomach acid."
3536,"Sleeping was possible.  It works well without making me sleepy the next day like Ambien did.  It also works quickly as long as you lie down right away. Bad taste in mouth in the morning was bothersome in the beginning but it goes away over time the longer you take the drug.  However, lineage did not work well at all if I ate anything near bed.  The directions say it does not work well with fatty foods.  But, it also did not work if I even took a fish oil supplement, which is a fatty acid.  Even the smallest amount of fat, like a pat of butter on a piece of toast renders it ineffective.  When that happens, I would cut another pill in half and would be able to sleep.  This is a time release drug and should not actually be cut in half! Taken as needed for insomnia."

It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it, if I stay up watching tv or reading, when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  I had to go back to bed!  I love the drug and since I tend to be high strung anyway, I am sure that I am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone. I have had none of the side effects listed except for the ""may cause drowziness"" which is the whole reason I am taking trazadone.

The skin was very dry and difficult to moisturize.  The skin looked red and irritated.   However, when I switched to a lighter skin cleanser, Cetaphil, this really helped improve the redness and dryness.  Prior to the Cetaphil i was using Roc cleansing pads which were too harsh on my skin. My routine included Daily use of Micro Retin A pump.

It is so convenient not having to remember to take a pill everyday at the same day. It was also 100% effective with preventing pregnancy for me. The first side effect I noticed was my complete lack of sex drive. After this came the ridiculous mood swings that caused fights with my boyfriend over nothing. I would just cry for no reason at all and I felt like I was going insane. Breast tenderness was also becoming an annoyance because it would last for months. While these side effects were severe to me, the worst is the huge concave I now have in my thigh. While I had a total of four injections, only one caused a huge dimple. It's really embarassing and extremely noticable and I'm not sure why it happened. The doctor said it has happened to a few other patients including discoloration of the injection site. This is when I got off Depo and switched to Seasonique... Hopefully, this will work out better. If you don't like receiving shots, this is definitely not the right method. It is a pretty large injection.  However, you only have to endure it four times a month and it's not painful."

Prescribed by my psychiatrist to use in various doses over several years of use to use for anxiety and panic, and in conjunction with Klonopin as an effective measure to reduce a mixed/manic episode of bipolar disorder in an acute situation, and also at a low-level dose every day to reduce the chance of episodes from occuring.

So after a little research on the net, I came across this drug and reviews from people who have taken it.
I told and showed my doctor the results and he was happy for me to try this drug and I am glad that I did. Previous drugs gave me an instant irritating cough and also made my feet swell up.

It has made a positive difference in my quality of life. I have not experienced negative physical side effects that I am aware of.  This drug does not aid with digestion of food.  I still have nausea and vomitting but, not because the drug doesn't work.  My doctor explained my other symptoms result from food in stomach several hours after eating. I have tried every prescription medication for acid in stomach and had gall bladder removed.  I have modified my diet and avoid irritating foods and drinks.  With prevacid twice daily (normal dosage is once daily) I can eat and drink with less nausea.  Without it, my diet would have to be clear liquids and pulverized solids.  It has made a tremendous positive difference.  I do not want to stop taking it unless something better is approved.  It is not a treatment for the paresis.

Sprayed rash with HC Derma-Pax and applied Hydrocortisone Cream afterward. Continued med and random daily BP reading to advise cardiologist if BP altered by increased dosage.

447,"The ativan decreased my anxiety so that I was able to sleep through the night. 2 mg was way too much.  After 7 hours of sleep, I continued to be spaced out and clumsy, bumping into walls and dropping things for another 7 hours.  My mind also felt really slow, stunned and stupid.  These side effects were so strong, my co-workers noticed and were concerned for me.  A week later, I took half a pill to ease my anxiety and help me sleep.  The side effects were less, but still noticeable by others the next day at work.  The last two times I tried ativan, I only took 1/4 of a pill.  It did still ease my anxiety and the side effects were mild, but I decided I'd rather live with the anxiety than live with a mind that felt slow and stupid. Dissolve one tablet under the tongue at bedtime as needed to a maximum of 3 tablets per week."

753,Decreased sensitivity to Ragweed pollens during Fall season. With extended use I was prone to ulcers in the nasal cavities. Treatment was started one week prior to beginning of Ragweed season and continued at full dosage till one week past peak season. Dosage was then decreased by 50% till end of season.
505,"It allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that I could not ignore before. Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore. Getting on the drug was tough, because I endured insomnia, sweating, loss of appetite, high-anxiety, shaking, hands, and restlessness.  After about 2-3 weeks, however, all those symptoms went away, once my body got used to it.  I did have some weight gain, but I was really skinny to begin with. I've dealt with anxiety since I was a kid as well as obsessive thinking.  It continued to build until I was 17 and I had a major panic attack, which I could not calm down from.  My psychiatrist put me on Paxil CR and I worked up to 25 mg.  The dosage made a big difference, though I still had moderate levels of anxiety, but I could function.  About a year and a half ago I was hit with another major attack that send me into a relapse for about 2-3 months, then I upped my dosage to 37.5 mg and within a week I felt fine, even better than I felt before.  Now a year and a half later, I found myself in another relapse and after a week I released that all this time I was not at a high enough dosage because my anxiety and obsessive thoughts would still creep in and cause me distress.  So my psychiatrist agreed that I was not at my ideal dosage and I am now taking two 25 mg in the morning which equals 50 mg, which is still a fairly moderate dosage considering other patients that were on 80 to even 120 mg.  I just started taking it, so I should start feeling even better within about a week or two.  I've accepted that I may need to be on this for the long haul, which is fine.  I look at is as nutrition for the brain, or like taking insulin for diabetes, it allows me function and enjoy life."
2326,"I had hit the wall dealing with work, cllients,and family. My general physician asked me to see a therapist to help get me going in the right direction. After one meeting it was recommended by both caregivers that I take something to help me get through this rough spot. After about 3 weeks I started feeling like things were easier to cope with and I was making good decisions and getting things done again. The only side effect I believe is some weight gain, approximately 10 pounds!!!!! I take 1 lexapro daily. I have finished up with the therapist. I am feeling great."
521,Requip has helped me sleep at night! no more horrible creepy crawley sensations... great medication! None. Take 1 pill 2 hours before bedtime.
4014,I felt like I could handle my work and relationship stress better. I had strange bruises all over my legs and arms.  I lost my libido as well as not caring much about anything.  I felt like I had no emotion. I flushed them down the toilet after awhile because I wanted to have my personality back.
1763,"I first began taking Topamax when I was fifteen. I had severe migraines about five every week. When I started it did automatically begin helping me with the headaches, and then the side effects sat in very soon after. Yet, the weight loss side effect was the only positive. I lost twenty pounds. Within twenty minutes of taking Topamax I began to get tingles in my feet and bad in my hands. The next two weeks when they had moved my doze from 50mg to 100mg I felt like a dud in class. I couldn't remember anything that I would have been able to grasp so much more quickly before. I would stumble on my words and get so confused. On top of all this, I was constantly in a bad mood and depressed. I finally said enough was enough the day I got over heated at the lake, I got over heated because Topamax doesn't let you sweat. Overall, the side effects over ruled the relief. Above."

2565,"The drug has a very long half life and because of that property there is a long, smooth sustained effect of the drug. I did not feel highs or lows and hardly knew I was taking it except it helped my anxiety. occasional dry mouth I could not take any anti-depressant medications. I tried them all but had terrible side effects. My doctor is extremely good with medication therapy for depression and anxiety and decided I have a serotonin sensitivity and so put me on this drug which works on a different endorphin pathway called gabba. I have had terrific success on it and although it too has addictive properties like other Diazapenes, I have not had to increase my dose at all therefore he doesn't think true physiological dependence is developing."
3693,"Made a huge difference in my depression (post natal) at first. Had tried Zoloft after my previous pregnancy, which seemed to stop working. Cycled through a number of other drugs (8 within 9 months) and ended up sticking with EffexorXR as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially. Weight gain, difficulty losing weight, blurry vision, general 'blah' moods. 
Attempted to taper off & managed to only go from 225 to 150mg for a week before MAJOR side effects kicked in: headaches, brain 'zaps', aggression, agitation, extreme mood swings and hives. Returned to 225mg (for a month now) and still experiencing severe hives & developing allergies to a number of things I wasn't allergic to before. Post-natal depression & major depression/anxiety."

Sometimes I felt nausea, except that, there was no other significant side effect. Two pills everytime I had headache, avoiding to take more than 4 pills in one day."

One sister fractured her pelvic bone at 40 from bone loss. I had no side effects. I always followed the directions - take it with water. No other foods or drinks for an hour afterward. Don't ly down. I took the drug weekly for about 8 years. During that time I have had 3 bone scans. My bone loss subsided. I also drink a lot of diet soda though, and that can effect calcium intake. In the last year I have increased exercising with weights. I am due for another bone scan in the fall."
2482,After having a severe outbreak of psoriasis Enbrel was the only one that cleared it up in about a month. been on medication almost three years and still have some psoriasis flare ups but not as bad as it was before. Maybe caused more due to stress. Also joint swelling and pain in my legs have gone away still feel fatigued sometimes but common with the disease. Some bruising to the site of injections but doctors monitor it every three months and blood work comes back normal to good. I get treated for psoriasis and psoriatic artheritis. I take sure click injection myself once a week 50 mg.

During most of the 20 yrs. xanax (alprazolam) was prescribed. Worked great; 100% effective. Was put on clonazepam - worst feeling ever; 2 mg daily, extreme tiredness, couldn't function doing daily activities. Dropped down to 1mg per script; same effect as taking 2mg. Prescribed .05mg; same effect as above. Since learned clonazepam is a sedative medication. Would not recommend to anyone."
2422,"The drug Levothyroxine 100 mics daily that I took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. I did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where I felt lithargic and brain dead.If I inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, I felt like I would notice my sluggishness a few days later. I had no side effects. I have since stopped taking the Levothyroxine 100 mics daily. My provider explained to me since I was still feeling tired was to switch to the brand name Synthroid 100 mics daily. I have noticed a big difference in my energy level and alertness. I can't believe I have gone this long (15 years) feeling tired and out of sorts. I wish now I had been taking the brand name all along. No telling what things I may acomplished."
228,"elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed. none at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage. Inital treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation."
3675,"I was having panic attacks and very high anxiety. Effexor XR helped to reduce the anxiety and eliminate the panic attacks. My depression is much, much better. I have to take it with food or I get sick stomach. Otherwise I have no side effects. You must take a SSRI daily. If you skip a few days you start to feel like you are getting a really bad cold, and disoriented. They are hard to wean off of. Do not stop taking! Talk to your doctor if you feel you want to reduce your dosage."
1285,"I am able to stay awake while driving.  I am able to focus on tasks and concentrate better.  My concentration is clearer.  It's not habit-forming because I could live without it.  It's just that I can not function without it.  I can't drive, or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  My narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that I do not dream at night at all.  With the provigil, along with my other medications, I am able to balance day and night and not feel like I'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Also, I don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming. During the first week, my heart rate increased as I increased the dose, but now my heart rate is perfectly normal.  I believe it may have given me a little headache/stomach ache the first week as well, but those are gone now too. I take my provigil every morning, 3 200mg tablets.  I am awake for about the first 4 hours, then I nap for a little while.  I am up for about 2 hours, and nap again.  Then, I'm up for the evening, go to bed at a decent time and wake up at a regular hour feeling rested now."
3068,"One year after diagnosis, surgery and beginning chemotherapy for stage IIIc ovarian cancer, I am working 35+ hours per week and living more or less normally while receiving biweekly chemotherapy treatments.  Taking oxycodone makes all the difference in my quality of life, because it allows me to live without otherwise constant pain in my back, ribcage and belly.  In the absence of this pain, my mobility/activity level is excellent, I can think and focus clearly, and I am free of the depression and frustration of what could be a debilitating illness. Occasional fogginess if otherwise fatigued; otherwise, I am surprised at the absence of noticeable side effects. As I am aware of the addictive potential of narcotics/opioids, I have deliberately requested a continued low dose (5 mg) and have made a point of not increasing frequency to more than three tablets a day.  During the week after chemo, I will sometimes experience a bit of breakthrough pain between doses, and will then take a low (325 mg) dose of acetaminophen."
2155,"Moderate reduction in alergy symptoms an intollerable level of sedation. Even though I took the medication before bedtime, the next day I felt exhausted and mentally dull for the entire day. Given the moderate level of symptom relief, this was not a reasonable trade-off. Was instructed to take medication at bedtime to reduce sedating effects."
538,"They sometimes help me sleep throughout the night. Some nights when I feel really depressed, I feel like taking more.. but never do. Those were the nights that were really hard for me to fall asleep, even after taking the trazodone. I've only been on trazodone for about a month now, but already I experience a bad taste in my mouth. Also when im just lying down and relaxing I get this sharpe pain in my right ribs as well as down my right side into my mid back. It only began when I started taking this medication. .."

2508,"Keeping me from the effects of menopause. I believe the benefits were to keep my skin soft, prevent sagging and wrinkles I was prescribed estrogen at the time of my total hysterectomy (due to increasing bleeding and starting periods every 2 weeks). I was becoming anemic from the bleeding and other procedures to stop this were not very successful. I was about 45 at the time and was given the option to begin HRT. Over the years I have been given decreasing levels and am currently at .5mg. Even with the negative info regarding prolonged HRT, I opted to continue.  If you actually read the negative information, it was not related to estrogen, but rather to estrogen and progesterone in combination.  Since then more articles have further clarified some of the mis-information.  It may be a risk to continue long term HRT, but none of my doctors has really presented any solid reasoning to discontinue HRT."
1870,"It truly cleared my headache in three days. I felt no reason to finish the meds unless it was necessary. That pretty much sums it up as to say I would recommend it to others in need. I thank the drug and pharmecutical industry much indeed. Again, Thank you. None The treatment took away the migraine headaches. It opened up my head and cleared the mucus that clogged me with sinusitis. I was then able to breathe much better."
279,"Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me. Im sure it causes night sweats and significant weight loss.  Other side effects that may or may not be related that I experience (although I also started taking it after the birth of my first child and may be related to that rather than the Xyrem)were receeding hairline, short term memory impact, some decrease in cognitive function such as difficulty with word recall, following a more complex line of reasoning, etc.., and increased anxiety.  Even given the side effects, my life is so much better now that I am not so exhausted and I can't imagine going back to life before Xyrem. 1 dose right before bed and another 3-4 hours later."
1419,"quick weight loss dry mouth, nervous jittery feeling and shaky I found that the side effects were so bad that I could not function so I decided to try the Phentramin D since it is designed to have the same effects. I have lost 56 pounds in four months and have never found anything better.

2312,"Increased libido. Vivid dreams, nightmares, diarrhea, increased anxiety, night sweats, exhaustion. Began at 5 mg, increased to 10mg after a few weeks.  Have not been able to increase further because the side effects are so detrimental.  I am weaning myself off Lexapro now and beginning Celexa again.  I had a better experience on 20 mg of Celexa and it is far less expensive (because there is a generic)."
603,"I did not experience any benefits whatsoever. I suffered increased anxiety, more dilusions, several migraine headaches, insomnia and tremors.  I became even more unable to function than I was prior to taking the drug. The drug was prescribed as an anti-psychotic to ease the unrealistic thoughts I was having despite taking prozac."
3708,"Decreased redness and bumpiness by day 6. I believe the benefits were associated with the prescribed medication. However, I was also using a histamine blocking topical cream during the course of treatment. None noted Rash of unknown origin. Intense itching, redness, and bumpy texture beginning on neck and slowly migrating around to appendages. Took prescription described above, as recommended. On Day 6, I noticed decreased irritation associated with rash."
503,"completely ended panic attacks,most sweating,most blushing,much discomfort. more anxiety at first for about 3 weeks. some headaches,nausea I started the medicine 8-10 years ago and took the medicine religously to begin with. Took about 4 weeks to really make a difference. However, did notice change after only a couple weeks. I slack off many times and after a day or two of missed pills I notice dizziness and mild headache plus some nausea. Not good to do, but it happens. After being on the medicine as many years as I have, I don't think it is as effective as others may be, but I have tried many...Prozac,Zoloft and numerous others I don't remember the name of and nothing worked as well for me as Paxil..Another note is that anxiety runs in my family and a few aunts and uncles in my family have had the same good luck with Paxil. I often wonder since we are related if it treats something in our brain the same as it seems to work for this family??? Something to think about if you know someone else in your family that suffers from depression or other mental illness."

525,Oh my gosh I am in heaven I have suffered with restless legs for 20 years reallyA little nauseau when I first started bad. I was up walking the floor every nite at least 5 to 10 times a nite.  To me it is a miracle.  I have not had any restless legs since I started. I had a little feeling of nausea in the beginning I take 2 pills about 1 to 2 hours before bedtime.
3592,I had acne constantly and would break out a few time a week.  My breakouts have gotten better and only occur occaisionally. The only side effects I have seen are some dryness on the face. I use the Differin gel 0.3% on my face and neck every night.  The Differin has helped with the break outs but I do not notice and difference in lines or wrinkles.
2585,"The drug caused the iris to contract so that the drains that relieve fluid buildup causing high pressure are pulled open.  While using the drug the pressure in my eyes remained stable but high.  It had the added benefit of sharpening my vision for a long time so that I did not need to wear glasses for reading phonebooks,etc. The iris atrophied.  It is now impossible for my pupil to open to adjust to changing light conditions.  The iris aslo scarred to the lense making a followup cataract removal operation complicated.  The drug sped up the formation of cataracts. The drug in drop form was put in each eye three times a day.  It was a nuisance to have to carry it with me for mid day application.  The chemicals in the drops sting and leave your eyes watering for a minute or so.  Otherwise it was easy to use, although the proper technique for putting in the drops without touching the eyeball takes a little practice and a steady hand"
2439,"The benefits of treatment were a lifting of depression, specifically as it relates to Wellbutrin, to elevate the ceiling of emotions. It also had a midly energizing effect. Very occassionally a racing feeling if I took the two doses too close together. I've used wellbutrin in combination with other anti-depressants, but it is usually the other one (Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor) that loses it's effect after time. Wellbutrin has remained consistently reliable and contributes to the livlier aspects of mood elevation for me."
3218,"Peace of mind that I am doing something to decrease the MS progression. Site reactions: pain, redness, lumps, flush of heat, itchiness I was on copaxone over a year ago and quit because I found the reactions unbearable. My health has declined and I changed doctors and now that I have found the confidence to accept my disease and become more proactive, I have begun applying heat to the site prior to injection. The pain from the shots have practically disappeared. I actually purchased a massager (heart massager from pure romance) that self heats and I don't have to do so much work prior to injection. I still get large red lumps if I don't put ice on it after the injection."
3316,"the treatment benefits was that the skin irritation did go away for awhile. I thought that I had been cured of the skin rash. It cleared my skin up and gave me relief from the rash. It turns out it did not cure it at all but possibly hurt my face.  It also may have made the condition spread to other areas of my face because in time I had other areas of my face where the rash was.  The cream was only a temporary relief to a deeper situation. If one is looking for fast relief it will help but it covers up an initial problem that needs to be addressed. I saw a few dermatologists and each one told me to use it twice daily. I was even given different forms. One a cream and the other a foam.  I was also informed to use them for two weeks and then stop. I did, and when I stopped my rash slowly started coming back."

None--until the 3rd to 4th day when I experienced HORRIBLE esophagitis. and heartburn which felt like a big air bubble in the middle of my chest---at first I thought it was a heart attack. I know this was prescribed because I'm allergic to penicillin and was having dental surgery.  BUT given the side effects and the pain I would NOT take it again.  A pharmacist advised me to take Prilosec q.a.m. and an antacid between doses.  It helped a bit, but I would have asked for another medicine if it had been earlier in the treatment."

1439,"I had experienced decreased energy and increasing tiredness for several years.  It got to the point I was taking naps for the first time since I was a small child, and still didn't feel refreshed.  I also felt cold frequently and had put on a good 20 pounds in a year.  When I went for my annual physical, my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  I thought it was advancing middle age.  Fortunately, my MD put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  I was very low.  Within two weeks, I felt energized and my mood improved.  I have shed some (not all, darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower. I had none except for a few hot flashes (well past menopause) that went away in the first few weeks.  I have never been a pill-taker for fear of side effects, but this was a good experience.  Fortunately, the initial dose was effective and did not need adjustment. As I said, my doctor spotted the symptoms and ordered a thyroid test.  When it came back very low, she prescribed 75 mg a day of levothyroxine, and I felt a little better almost immediately.  Within 2 weeks, I felt younger, more energy, better mood and my weight gain stopped.  I have enough energy to exercize and with only a slight shift in my fairly healthy diet to less fat and more fruits and vegetables, the weight has slowly come off.  I have my thyroid checked every 6 months with good results so far.  Between the medication and some dietary changes, my cholesterol is down from 230 to 206.  I still have about 6 pounds to get back to my starting weight.  Unless there's a permanent cure out there, I won't mind taking this little lifesaver forever."
2826,"So far it's only been 3 days.  Wellbutrin seems to give me a spike of energy which is nice.  Still have the craving for cigs so I'm continuing to smoke like I usually do. Sometimes I lash out for no reason at all.  With Lexapro I remember having to wait a few weeks to get results, so I'm sure I'll wait. Doc says to wait, that's the treatment.  I'm hoping like many this treatement will help me stop smoking and ease my depression.  You have to change your life and make yourself a better person, not just rely on drugs to cure you.  So, I'm working on the little things in life to change."
3192,"The treatment cured the sore throat for which it was perscribed. During the 10 days taking the drug there were no side effects, however the day after the last dosage, I began having severe diarrhea, which persisted and was diagnosed as a bacterial infection called clostridium difficil, caused by the antibiotic I had taken. I took omnicef orally for 10 days.  After the clostridium difficil was diagnosed, I had to start a new course of drugs which had to be repeated before the new infection/condition was cured."

She was also on a lot of other medications and I think the combination of medicines put her into heart attack and she passed away. She took one pill at the Doctors office and she took one home to take.  She died some time that night.  I think it was too much medication and combination of different medicines.  I miss her so much.

Extremely lethargic the entire next day, even if I took the meloxicam by itself I am supposed to take the tablet once a day, however due to how tired I get for the entire next day, I only take as needed.  I did not figure out the problem with this drug until my son had to take it for something and he was totally wiped out as well.  So, I really try to use as little as possible, even though I have a permanent prescription for it."
1338,"Stabilized my moods, stopped my racing thoughts, and stomped all over my paranoia Confusion, craving sweets I was afraid to take an antipsychotic when I first found out I was bipolar in April 11 but the other treatments weren't working and I decided to ask my doctor about Seroquel XR and I'm glad I did. It's the first drug that survived a refill :) and many more to come. My paranoia has stopped and depression lifted. I still get anxiety but clonazepam helps with that and I'm trying to work on that On my own too."
3720,"Generally, Lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying). The mood difference is noticeable. My pscychiatrist prescribed Lamictal to me because, as a mood stabilizer, Lamictal is often used to treat resistant depression. Considering that I had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression, this was an appropriate choice. I have noticed no side effects. I take 100 MG of Lamictal orally, twice a day. Generally, I take the first pill when I wake up in the morning, and I take the second pill with dinner."
2761,"Psychotic thoughts went away.  No longer thought people were out to get me.  Became less suspicious of people.  Iritability decreaed while on this medication.  This medication has worked wonders for me. None at all for me.  I have tolerated this medication very well. Started this medication in October 2008 for my suspiciousness of people (thought people were out to get me).  Began at 0.25 mg once a day for a week, then increased to 0.5 mg a day at night.  3 weeks later (1 month from the time of starting risperidone), increased to 1 mg every night.  Stayed on 1 mg for a few months when the symptoms came back.  Dose increased to 1.5 mg a day.  Depression set in (for outside life factors...not due to medication) and fluoetime added at 10 mg a day and risperidone decreased to 1 mg a day due to flueoxetine increasing the levels of risperidone.  Depression still there and psychotic symptoms came back.  At next vist (1 month) flueoxetine increased to 20 mg every morning and risperidone increased back to 1.5 mg a day.  Two months later psychotic symptoms would come back in the middle of the day (as if the medication was wearing off).  Rispreridone dosage changed to 1 mg twice a day.  Which is still the current dosage I am on."

The pain that I normally get in my chest (from my Crohn's) is gone. 
I feel better and I am not as tired. It is a wonder drug and I wish they would run more trials so more people can gain the benefits of this drug. Other drugs started out this way and were tested off label for other diseases, why not LDN.

1690,"I suffered swollen and extremely sore throats with lots of mucus gathering up at the back of my throat. Because of this, I ended up having my tonsils and adenoids removed separately but this did not help at all. I also relieved several treatments for antibiotics but this was wasted as all they did was lowered my immune system. After being diagnosed with an airborne allergy, I took one tablet daily, they worked on the first day and completely helped. The drowsiness was overwhelming, I was sleeping for about 16hours a day with no relief after and my appetite increased rapidly. I was consuming about three times my usual intake. Overall, they worked but the side affects were incredibly bad."
91,"depression decreased while on this drug I experienced minimal side effects, the only side effect was loss of appetite and weight loss which in my opinion isn't exactly a bad thing.  The other side effect that I experienced was loss of emotion, I was neither happy nor sad.  This is what made me stop taking the medication.  I switched to zoloft which worked just made me gain 18 lbs and now in the process in switching to something else. see above"
2874,It reduced my acne considerably. It provided a very smooth feeling to my skin that I did not experience with anything prior to using this medicine. It also gave me a rosier complexion with a glow. The only side effects i experienced were a slight stinging feeling. this subsided after the first two weeks. If the stinging sensation does not subside it is preferable to use it every other night instead of every night. I used this every night after cleansing my face. I waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before the application. It was also recommended by my doctor to wear sunscreen the next morning since this medication causes skin sun sensitivity.
354,"None Nausea, extreme sleepiness,severe headache, jittery, not myself,extremely grouchy, easily upset. Day one I felt negative side effects after taking the second dose. Day two, escalation of side effects, headache, sun sensitivity, foul mood. By day three I felt like a zombie and my head felt like it was going to explode. I could not bare noise, even my husbands voice and my own voice was too loud. I had slept a lot but never waking rested, just extremely sleepy and depressed. I called pharmacist on weekend and was told I was taking too much to start. She explained that with this medicine one needs to start low dose and work up. I reduced the dose but did not have a reduction of side effects. I went off before a week."
1925,"Decreased sputum production and increased lung function. none I take a 2 month course of Zithromax, half a tablet daily, about twice a year to alleviate exacerbations of chronic Pseudomonas Auriginosa chest infection associated with Cystic Fibrosis. It works excellently in conjunction with a 2 week course of nebulised tobramycin (Tobi) to reduce symptoms and decrease sputum production. I believe one of its main actions is its anti inflammatory effect. Also I believe that it inhibits the ability of Pseudomonas to stick to the lungs. This is a great weapon in the arsenal against CF. 

I hope this helps your research and look forward to receiving my Skin Care DIY pack. Thank you."
797,Sleeping 7-8 hours without hangover Memory loss It is a GODSEND. Fully rested in the am and feel like a new person. I am convinced it has kept me from sliding into a full depression. It works on 3 levels for me: 1. My body gets rest so I can 'fight' for another day. 2. My brain heals. 3. I can endure a difficult day knowing I can take the pill and go to sleep. I consider it a miracle cure for preventing a full blown depression. Wish I had it available to me years ago...could have changed my life. I would recommend to anyone in for a good experience while getting to sleep!
2586,"THE TREATMENT BENEFIT IS TO CONTROL THE GLUCOSE IN MY BLOOD, ALONG WITH A HEALTHY DIET AND AVOID SWEETS AND STARCHES. NO SIDE EFFECTS SO FAR, BUT ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAVE SOME EFFECTS WITH THE YEARS. THAT'S WHY I TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS. I TAKE ONE ACTOS 15 MG IN THE MORNING. HAVE BLOOD TESTS DONE EVERY 3 MONTHS TO CHECK MY KIDNEYS, GLUCOSE LEVEL, CHILESTEROL, ETC. ALSO HAVE MY EYES CHECK EVERY 12 MONTHS, AND MY FEET AS WELL."

Treatment is simple. I only spray in nostrils twice a day."
1458,"Quickly helped with depression and nearly eliminated pain soon after starting.  Effects lasted for roughly four months. Initially euphoria (lasted about three days), afterwards urinary hesitancy (stopped after about two months), dry mouth, mild fatigue, anorgasma. Started using Cymbalta 60mg to primarily for chronic tension headaches and neck/back pain and the resulting depression from chronic pain.  Worked wonderfully for about three months then slowly lost effectiveness.  Tried increasing to 90mg with little response.  Ended up switching antidepressants and finding different means to treat the pain.
It was a good drug when it worked, but unfortunately it didn't last very long.  It also acts on serotonin like an SSRI and started my dependency on SSRIs."
3383,"My blood cholesterol decreased from 260 to 190-210 and my LDLs dropped  and now hover around 100 mg/dl; always had high HDL levels of 84-92.  Needed to keep my VLDLs low too. No side effects high cholesterol, 260, at menopause and 2 younger brothers with heart attacks in early 50s.  Both brothers had high blood VLDLs.  So took Lipitor to keep blood cholesterol levels down because of family history of high blood cholesterol on both maternal and paternal sides of family."
803,"Occasionally I have a difficult time falling asleep and sleeping through the night.  When I take this medicine I fall asleep within 15 or so minutes and am able to sleep 7 or 8 hours.  My sleep seems undisturbed and uneventful.  When I wake up in the morning I awake completely alert and energized. I did not experience any treatment side effects. I have been taking this medication for occasional insomnia for over one year now.  
I will continue to take this medication to treat my insomnia for as long as my physician prescribes it for me."
726,"Minimized pigmentation. Some of my acne scar has faded but some still remain. peeling. It has made my skin really dry. Caused irritation and more redness. Skin was very sensitive once a day at night time for a period of 3 month. I wear sunscreen every day. However, I have stopped using it after reading the reports that it has harmful side effects in the long term."
811,allowed me to sleep soundly without feeling groggy in the morning. I didn't have any side effects if I was allowed enough sleep.  If I did not receive enough sleep it would be very hard to wake up and I would feel as if I had not slept at all making it very hard to stay alert.  I would say at least 6-7 hours of sleep is needed. Take one daily at bedtime for rest due to anxiety.  This prescription was issued for six months and I am currently still taking it.  It does not appear to be addictive as there are nights when I can sleep without it and do not crave it.
2941,"The benefits were remarkable and fast.  Before taking the mirapex, the patient got very little sleep and consequently was irritable.  After taking the mirapex, the restless legs calmed down immediately.  The patient can now go to a movie, take a trip in a car and sleep with a reasonable amount of comfort.  The restless legs are not totally cured, but it is manageable now.  Even working 8 hours a day is much more manageable. The only side effect that the patient experienced was drowsiness and that has weakened as time has gone by.  With only taking one pill at noon, the drowsiness is not marked and does not interfere with work or anything else.  The patient takes 2 pills around 8 or 9:00 at night so the drowsiness is not a problem. The patient developed restless leg syndrome around the age of 35 after a boating accident where her back was injured.  The doctors do not know if the back injury brought on the restless legs or not.  The patient went to many doctors and neurologists.  The doctors tried many medicines but with no success.  Finally the patient found a neurologist in central Kansas that figured out immediately what was wrong.  The doctor put the patient on mirapex on a trial basis after performing many tests to rule out other causes or problems.  The patient has never been on another medicine for restless legs since going on the mirapex.  The  patient does take a multivitamin with iron in it to help with the restless legs and the patient also does not have caffeine drinks."
839,"I now have more energy, better focus, better weight control, less hypglycemia, feel more upbeat, less prone to depression.  I can work more efficiently now, can get through my day without feeling like I need to lie down on the floor and sleep! I notice that if I drink caffeinated beverages I get way too jittery, whereas I used to use coffee and diet caffeinated drinks to keep my energy level up and they wouldn't bother me by making me too hyper.  So I have to stay away from those.  Also, if I take a dose too late in the day, I stay up too late! I have fibromyalgia, and was having a hard time with the high fatigue levels and difficulty concentrating.  At first I just took Wellbutrin to help with these things, but a doctor suggested trying Ritalin for better results.  It does work much better than the Wellbutrin for these symptoms."
3108,"The Ortho Tri-Cyclen provided effective birth control, and it also did cause my mentstrual cylcle to be more regular. My periods were less heavy, and I did not have such severe menstrual cramping each month while I was taking the pills. There are no other benefits to taking the pill that I am aware of. I experienced migraine headaches several times per week where I could not do anything other than lay down with the lights off while on this medication. At first, I had no idea what was causing them, but my doctor informed me that my symptoms could be indicative of a more severe side effect, and she therefore advised me to stop taking them. They also caused some bloating and moodiness. The Ortho Tri-Cyclen birth control pills are a low dosage progesterone treatment that is intended to prevent pregnancy. I was required to take one pill every day. My understanding is that I experienced a relatively rare side effect with the migraines. I have not heard any similar complaints from friends who were taking the same pill, other than complaints about weight gain, bloating and mild acne."
3345,"Noticeably lowered blood pressure and stress level when taken.  If the patient missed a dose, he became more easily agitated.  When the Lipitor was administered, agitation would subside within 1/2 an hour.  The patient has a family history of hypertension, heart disease and sleep apnea.  Therefore, controlling hypertension is a major concern for this patient and may actually save his life. Erectile function seemed to be mildly affected by this drug.  Sexual performance became slightly more challenging once the patient began taking this medication and was noticeably improved when the patient missed a dose. Lipitor was administered in pill form.  The patient received the prescription from a sliding scale clinic.  The patient also received a cardiogram, which revealed a 30% blockage.  Alcohol consumption, diet, and exercise are the primary barriers to this patient's health improvement.  He consumes an average of ~6 alcoholic beverages per day.  His diet includes many whole grains and vegetables, but also a large amount of fat and cholesterol.  The patient exercises sparatically and becomes fatigued quickly during physical activity.  Patient smoked for several years, but quit approximately 2 years ago."
3526,"Lunesta helped me sleep the first few times I took them and gave me 5-6 hours of sleep without waking up every hour (like I normally do without taking it). After taking it before bed, anything you drink or eat will taste metallic-like and that includes bottled water. Drinking a whole bottle of water with that metallic-taste made me vomit and that taste is still there when you wake up in the morning but goes away after you've been awake for 10-15 minutes. Occasionally, I will have hangover-like symptoms like feeling nauseated, depressed, and constant headaches all day long. If you miss one night, you will not be able to get any sleep at all. I've gone 72 hours without sleep once because I ran out and the pharmacy took forever to refill it. In the mornings when you wake up, you will need at least 4 cups of coffee to get out of bed. I've tried everything from reducing the dosage to sleeping earlier than normally and nothing helps to prevent that problem. All in all, not any fun. I'm still taking Lunesta but that's only because I am supposed to see my doctor this week to discuss modifications and adjustments."
765,"Effective inrelieving runny or clogged nose due to allergies, stops itchy,swelling and watering eyes. Only lasted for 8 hours max, I was given specific instructions not to use more than once a day, so I still had to rely on over-the-counter pills after the 8 hours were up.  Caused asthma in cold, dry weather and a very, very scratchy throat, as in physically having to scratch at my throat to relieve it.  Worsened a pre-existing eczema condition. Used 2 pumps per nostril, once a day to relieve everyday allergies."
2417,"Hypothyroidism treatment -- restores proper thyroxine levels in body, not produced by my damaged thyroid gland. Without the medication, I would have not developed properly, and today I would suffer dramatic effects on energy levels, puffiness, cholesterol plaqueing and worse.

1083,"I suffered from debilitating migraines.  The first treatments of anti-depressants were effective, but the side effects became intolerable.  After 
trying other types of medications, Effexor (both XR and regular release) have been a blessing. I suffer no side effects and in the laast 5 years have only had to increase the dosage one time. Previous medications (Nortrytpaline, amatryptaline) had a major sedative reaction.  I was unable to get up in the mornings and was sleepy all day long.
Also a dry mouth contributed to tooth decay as I was always having some sort of 
mint or candy or gum in my mouth. My Effexor treatments as simple, just take the drug once a day on the extended release type."
3789,"I was prescribed Keflex to take as a precaution to prevent infection prior to a scheduled surgery.  I took if for several days before and after the surgery. This drug gave me very strange dreams. I was instructed to take Keflex 3 times a day, or it might have been 4, but that I did not have to wake myself up at night to take it."
1681,"I only took it one time, and experienced a side effect (dry mouth). Did not really kick in, but I guess this med. is not supposed to work immediately I had a dry mouth and my eyes were dry. Basically I had allergies and severe allergy seasonal cough. Doctor told me to try Claritin. I only took it once just to see if the drug would work. The drug did not work right away. As it is stated in the label, this drug takes time (perhaps about a week) in order to be effective. I ended up not taking anything. As soon as mid June came around, the allergies and cough that lasted about 3 months all went away."
4113,"Definately helps control the urge to smoke.  Was able to make it through the first week of no smoking with VERY CONTROLABLE urges. Disrupted sleep is the only side effect so far.  However, I'm military and deployed, so sleeping well in these conditions is a luxury anyway.  Vivid dreams...I'm remembering my dreams, which is not normal for me.  Occasional nightmare, and frequent waking. 2 pills a day as prescribed.  I recommend it, but results obviously vary.  A few friends have also used it with identical results.  None of us take *any* other medication, which may be a substantial variable.  So far no suicidal thoughts or rages."
133,"I took this medication, Valtrex, upon first experiencing the sensation of tingling and itching symptoms associated with the onset of the beginning of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak on my face which I had experienced many times before - usually once a year.
The next day after taking valtrex as prescribed, redness of the area affected on my face did develop and a blister did appear to be forming, but the affected area had ceased to itch. 
By the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.
On the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.
By the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as I had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a 10 to 12 day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters. 
This medication made a real and positive difference for me in the development, disconfort and duration of the symptoms of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak. No negative side effects were experienced. Take two tablets by mouth with water twice daily for one day."
643,"This pill is awesome! Except for mild breakthrough bleeding (results of not taking it at same time every day) nothing. I have been on the Birth control patch for years and after switching to seasonique, the change is amazing.  My mood swings have stopped, my sex drive is back and my period is almost non-existant!  This is seriously going to save my marriage ;)  Love this pill!!!!"
743,"The fluticasone propionate shrinks the polyps when used as directed. The smaller the polyps the better one can breath; also the irritation from the polyps is reduced. I experienced blood when I would blow my nose and dryness in the nasal cavities. I also experienced palpitations, which are not a listed side effect. This was the only medication I was on and when I stopped using it the palpitations abated. Fluticasone propionate is useful for shrinking and maintaining a smaller size of polyp when used regularly. One must stay on the spray though to maintain an improvement. It is an alternative to surgery."
2526,"the infection vanished after 2 days, I had already tried canesten cream and that did not help cure the infection fully. none I could see, the infection vanished after 2 days and did not come back. i don't know if there are any side effects by taking the tablet you may wish to look in to it further. One tablet and then cream twice a day for a week. The tablet was taken once only. I used the cream a few more times during the day in the beginning of the treatment when I needed it."
1197,"None None Took for several months, told my doctor it was NOT making a difference so she doubled the dose to 40 mg. I couldn't stand the thought of putting more chemicals in my body if they weren't doing anything so I never filled the doubled prescription and focused on counseling, which made a difference."
3334,"I experienced nearly immediate decreased acne, without any of the dreaded sun sensitivity. It decrease papuless, whiteheads and blackheads all similarly. The medicine took effect almost immediately. I was not aware was supposed to take on empty stomach and yet still effective. none I also used topical clindamycin daily and benzoyl peroxide over the counter (when remembered). Both clinda and benzoyl persoxide I had tried taking previously without the addition of the tetracycline with little to no benefit."
2029,Reduced acid in the stomach and heartburn symptoms associated with acid. I didn't experience any side effects while taking this medication. Took 1 40 mg tablet in the morning before my first meal and controlled the acid reflux symptoms and stomach aches. Then took 1 40 mg tablet before I went to bed to once again control those symptoms while sleeping for a 24 hour effect.
905,concentration and anxiety levels returned to normal were very good. Felt so much better on the medication. Really noticeable quite quickly the benefits. Tiredness... feeling sleepy/lack of energy. debilitating. Have tried various over the counter stuff 2 help.. but to not much avail. take last thing at night. suits me better. some pple prefer taking in the morning.
409,"the only complete relief from one sided headache and nausea slight fatigue occasional tachycardia I was prescribed 100mg dosage pills, which are about the same price ($15/pill) as 50 mg. Taking a whole pill gave me relief but also a light headed sensation and odd heartbeat. I bit the pills in two to take approx. 50mg.  Gradually my system became inured to it's effects and I had to take the whole pill, also occasionally it just doesn't work anymore.  I have long lasting recurring headaches and have always been worried about overuse and rebound headaches, but so far, so good."
3083,"No change in acne despite 15 days of usage -- probably antibiotic resistant. Upset stomach, headache. Nausea could be combatted with ingestion of yogurt. I have had acne for 30 years, and have used several different treatments. Most effect was Benzamycin, but very drying. Most recent doctor prescribed Minocycline to reduce current breakout. But no effect."
1122,normal thrombosin level within 6 weeks none 1 pill every morning
3981,"My stomach aches went away. I wasn't as nauseated as I would have been without anything. I have been getting headaches sporadically and the doctor said this is a possbile side effect. Also, I was very nauseated the first 2 weeks, which they say happens in 30% of the population taking this drug, but then it subsided. I am taking this medication after being diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I was on Zelnorm for this and it was like a miracle drug!! It fixed all my problems for months, then it went off the market. The doctor then told me to try this as an option. It definately helps more than not taking anything at all and I can tell when I get these stomach pains that I forgot to take the drug."
836,"The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month. Excessive sleepiness, lack of concentration, feelings similar to those that one would experience taking oxycodone.  I felt ""high"" for many hours after taking this drug. The plan was a permanent solution to my occasional flare-ups of sciatica.  My physician basically stated that there was no cure for my pain; therefore, I needed to be placed on a prescription regimen that would hopefully reduce the occurrence and/or frequency of sciatica.  Each bottle contained a 60 day supply with enough refills to last me an entire year.  I have 2 herniated discs, one at L4-L5 and the other at S1.  The herniation at L4-L5 was causing pressure on my sciatic nerve which runs down the length of the left leg.  For me, this drug was not effective; perhaps, if I had continual pain I would learn to live with the side-effects.  I did stop taking any medications for my condition and am learning to cope without prescriptions at this time.  It appears that eventually I will need to take medication but I want to avoid feeling ""doped up"" for as long as possible."
4105,Eliminated nicotine cravings and made smoking cessation very easy. slight stomach naseau if not taken with food. first week 1 pill per day while smoking continued. Doubled dosage from day 8 on and stopped smoking. Was able to stop taking medication after 3 weeks. No smoking recurrence for 10 months.
1126,"The treatment benefits are long term.  There is no immediate benefit to be seen.  My doctor advised me that a follow-up dexa scan should be performed in two years to determine if the treatment is effective in reversing or at least arresting the osteopenia.  The drug is supposed to reduce risk of breast cancer. I experienced some mild hot flashes during the month I took the drug.  These hot flashes were not of the intensity that I experienced when I first started to experience menopause.  I did have more ackiness in my bones and joints when I first starting taking it but these went away after the first few weeks. I was given one month's free sample of Evista by my doctor.  I took one 60 mg pill each morning with 600 mg Calcium with Vitamin D as directed by my doctor.  I also walk 30 minutes daily on my treadmill, again at my Dr.'s direction.  I refilled the presciption at a local discount ""member's only"" store and paid $106 for one month of the drug. I have since purchased the drug on line for about half the cost.  Once I receive it, I will resume taking the drug.  Looks like I'll have about a two week vacation.  Biggest concerns about taking this drug are blood clots and stroke.  You are not allowed to smoke and alcohol consumption needs to be kept to a low level because it's not good for the bones. Other lifestlye issues related to healthy bones are followed."
277,"While taking Xyrem, I slept exceptionally well at night, woke up rested, and strangely, within months of starting the medication, lost fifteen or more pounds. Some nights I felt significant joint pain, primarily in my elbows and my shoulders.  Other nights I suffered night sweats so severe that I would have to change out of my wet pajamas.  On occasion when falling asleep I would feel very giddy, almost ""high."" Lack of sleep severely impacts my mood and none of the other sedative medications that I had tried worked, so I tried xyrem with beneficial effects."
2407,"This dosage was supposed to help the thyroid function correctly. However, it appeared to make me more lethargic, even though the blood test showed that it was working correctly. I experienced more benefit from exercise than from taking this mandatory drug. I experienced weight gain fluctuations and loss of energy. I complained to several doctors over the period of 20 years without effect. There is no alternative treatment if the patient does not feel the benefit. The doctor only sees the blood test to show that the treatment is effective. No treatment, other than taking a blood test every 6 months to see if the level was correct, regardless of the side effects. I found this offensive since I clearly gained 20 pounds when on the medication than when I was not on the medication (or the dosage was reduced)."

I endured daily moderate to severe headaches which I had to treat with high dosage of ibuprofen and a 50 lb. weight gain over two months on a 5'2"" frame with no change in my diet. I could not shake the weight until I discontinued taking the med. Treatment was to take the med. daily. It controlled the seizure disorder but the side effects were too much for me. I talked to the physician after two years and said it's gotta go. He then prescribed Lamictal and I lost 40 lbs. in one month--simply by stopping the Depakote."
70,It allowed me to relax and sleep.  My neck and back pain subsided a little.  It made me forget most of my pain. drowsy when i first woke up but once i got moving around it went away The doctor had me take flexeril 3 times a day but i started out with 1 at bedtime for 2 1/2 weeks.  It took 2 weeks to work but after i started taking it 3 times a day at it worked faster.  It helps to stretch also while you take flexeril.

1862,"After the first day on this drug, my ear pain was gone.  Sinuses cleared soon thereafter. While taking augmentin, I had trouble sleeping.  When I did finally fall asleep, I had very vivid, strange dreams.  Also noticed mild vaginal discharge.  Some dizziness, but nothing major. I feel that this med did the job of clearing my sinus infection and ear pain.  Side effects were bearable.  I would take it again."

2167,"Controlled allegies very well When Zyrtec became over the counter and sold this medicine, something was changed in the formula which caused severe hair loss.  After a long process of elimination to find out the cause I stopped Zyrtec and my hair came back.  This also happened to my teenage daughter. I took Zyrtec for many years without adverse reaction.  Only when it became OTC did the problem begin."
859,"Helped greatly in as much as wasnt crying as much and was able to sleep a little better. only that it made me a bit lethargic but not noticeably so. Would only take a tablet when I was feeling particularly vulnerable for example at the funeral and times when feeling overcome. I think that this is the best thing about valium you only have to take it when you really need it and it works almost immediately and for me without undesirable side effects. You just have to be careful and not take constantly for long periods of time.I know of many people who have been prescribed the newer anti depressants and have gone through the most horrendous side effects, personally I wouldnt touch them."
1051,"The Femring is great because you insert it and don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill or pills every day. This allows you freedom for the next three months, (90) days until your reorder a new ring.  Also my insurance pays a good portion of the cost of the ring, whereas it did not cover the cost of bio-identical horomone treatments. The bad thing about this certain dosage of the Femring was on the third day it seemed as though I was beginning to have vaginal irritation.  The fourth day was obvious vaginal irritation with a blistery rash.  Upon feeling and seeing this rash I removed the Femring and called my Dr. A lower dose Femring was prescribed, 0.05mg/day, which does a good job of returning my horomones levels to close to normal."
1724,To stop the infection of cystitis and other urine infections when it became too painful.It makes the passing of water less painful and reduces the passing of bloody quicker which can become very painful. none that I'm aware but it didn't always work when I used it. I'd no if it didn't work within 30 mins it wouldn't work at all. You can build up and immunity quite quickly to this drug which lessens the effectiveness of the drug You take 200mg tablets twice a day for 3 days
2296,"Severe long term depression and anxiety were alleviated. Yawning, tiredness, lethargy, dry eyes/sinuses. Over time the drug seemed to build up in my system (the Dr. determined that I metabolize this particular drug slowly)and my dosage had to be adjusted to 5mg/day. 5mg/day takes the edge off the depression but does not cause the extreme exhaustion experienced at higher doses.

This medication is excellent despite some mild side effects. It does not cause any of the musculo/skelatal pain or sleep interuptions I experienced with other anti-depressants. treatment began 3 years ago, 20mg/day was adusted to 10mg/day taken at bedtime for 2 and a half years. 4 months ago dosage was decreeased to 5mg/day at bedtime."
1638,"Better heart condition, stronger bones taken along with my calcium None that I can see Once daily I am taken Premarin .0625mg and I am planning to try the new dosage of .045 mg.

3797,"Suppression of cough Drowsiness, dizziness, dream-like state, very mild haluccinations, weakness in arms I was battling a severe, deep, incessant cough, and was diagnosed with mycoplasma bronchitis, probably contracted from my spouse who had walking pneumonia. I couldn�t go for more than 2 minutes without coughing, and couldn�t sleep through the night.  After suffering for well over a week, I finally was prescribed Tussionex (my spouse was too), and it was the most amazing relief � it suppressed the cough, and I could finally sleep. Due to the side effects, I haven�t taken it for any common colds or flus, but it was worthwhile for my severe cough."
3387,"Considerable less craving for alcohol Sometimes drowsy, easily tired Treatment started in an alcohol rehabilitation clinic january 2010 in the netherlands. Baclofen is generally known as a muscle relaxation medicine often used by people who have epilepsia. Initially 3times daily a total of 60 mg, after 6 months 90 mg per day, to increase effectiveness.

Patient describes that his alcohol cravings have nearly disappeared."
2978,"I was much more awake in the mornings instead of groggy and foggy -brained. I was able to focus a LITTLE bit better Blurry vision, increased bladder leaks,moodiness, a little weight gain which may not be from Strattera Unfortunately I had a doctor who was uneducated about ADD and was very uncomfortable prescribing any medications for it. She put me on 10mg first.After 3-4 weeks I went back and asked for her to increase it. She prescribed 20mg,(which I found they don't make 20mg doses) Instead of changing it to a proper mg, she decided to have me take 2 10mg pills every morning which also doubled the cost and that amount was not enough to have much benefit. After about a year , I was finally prescribed a therapeutic dosage of 40mg. I had too many problems with the pharmacy ordering the right amount ( they had me take 4 10mg pills a day because they didn't order the right ones! I have no health insurance so was getting it on some program that made it cost me $6 but when they would screw up the order , I would either run out or have to get the full amount which was $130.00 at the 10mgs, so X 2 for 20mg, x 4 for 40mgs!! Just because of the way the pharmacy was doing it.Scamming the federal programs or  something...so I finally just quit taking it. I definately had noticed that it made pee without barely any warning, and my eyesight got alot worse, and my fiance said it made me ""mean"". All that has stopped now that I am not on it. But my ADD is back full force!"
460,"I didn't see any benefits, what else can I say? I had to take this to counteract the side effects of clindamycin. Anorexia, insomnia, bone and joint pain, vomiting, irritability ( I'm still pissed about all this). Weakness depression, suicidal ideation, so weak I have been unable to leave my bed for more than a couple of hours a day. I'd rather just shit myself to death than to take this crap. Christ, if I didn't have leukemia, I just wouldn't even go to doctors. I mean, their ok if you need to get put back together after an accident or something, but most of the time they, and their petrochemical nostrums, just seem to cause mote problems than they cure. 3 pills a day for two weeks, symptoms came back, took it 4 more days and then, knowing what would be in store for me if I took it; I found that I could not force myself to take even one more pill."

3158,"This medication completely erased symptoms of the hives.  The first time that I took the medication the hives were already 2 days old, therefore, it took about 2 days for them to clear up. Now, if I ever feel the itch or see the blotchiness I can take one dose of this medicine and the hives do not progress and they are clear within one day. There were no side effects noticed with this medication. Take 2 tablets once per day."
4008,"For the depression it didn't make much of a difference; but it worked wonders for my anxiety. The edginess, nervousness, impatience, fear of socializing and going out of the house, completely disappeared after one month of taking it. My close friends even commented that 'I was my old self again'. I was much more relaxed and happy. It made me realize that I was misdiagnosed as depressed, when what I really have is anxiety. After talking to my new psiquiatrist, we came to that conclusion. COMPLETE loss of libido. That's why I discontinued the treatment. I started with 10mg/day, for one month, when I started to feel less anxious, but not motivated or more energetic, as expected from an anti-depressive medication. Then the dose went up to 20mg/day for another 3- 4 months, when no 'anti-depression' effects were noticed, the dose went up to 30 mg/day, it made no difference either. I have stopped taking it gradually (20mg/day for 1 week, then 10mg/day for 3 weeks) until i stopped completely. Now I'm waiting to see how I feel, to see if I 'll try another medication, since the side effect described above was intolerable to me."
1375,"Sinus and chest infections were much better after 7 days. No more sinus pain or runny nose, and was no longer coughing up mucus. Terrible bitter taste in the mouth, some mild nausea, and a yeast infection.

3210,"The treatment benefits are to help lower blood pressure.  Blood pressure is being monitored by the physician and the patient.  So far, the benicar has shown to be as beneficial as the previous medicine patient has been on for the last seven years.  Since the pill is considerably larger than previous medicine I was on, I do have to chew the pill. I have not noticed any side effects so far.  I have been taking the medicine about one month.  I plan to visit the doctor in eight weeks again at which time I am sure the doctor will check my blood for any changes that may have occurred.  But so far, nothing has been noticed. I have been on blood pressure medication for about seven years now.  Each doctor that I went to has changed my medication several times.  My blood pressure has been lower since visiting a nephrologist.  Recently I went to a regular general practitioner and she changed my medicine once again to the Benicar.  It seems to be helping somewhat with very few, if any, sign effects."
3160,"I went from being in extreme pain and sometimes almost immobile to being able to go back to work at a physical job So far all I,ve had is a little weight gain plus occasionally I have to take ib prophen in the evening to get rid of leg pain i sarted off with taking 3 - 5mg pills a day, over some moths I was down to 1 - 5mg pill a day.  I went off the medication a few days and was ok until the third day.  I went bace to taking 3 pills a day for a week, am now down to 2 a day and will go down to one a day next week. I then will bee taking 1 pill every two days.  The trick is to take as little as possible while not taking too little and having to start over again"

1544,the treatment masked the psoriasis and what was considered arthritis increasing all over body pain I started with 4 tabs and increased to 6 as the all over body pain increased and then they were going to put me on prednisone.  I opted to turn to homeopathic treatment and weaned off the methotrexate.  The all over body pain went completely away but the psoriasis was exacerbated.  I'd rather have that than not be able to walk or move.

I did not want to use the cream because it seemed to be heavy, possibly leading to breakouts. My doctor then gave me a presciption for noritate, which did not have the side effects I mentioned above. Plus, you only have to use it once per day, which I like alot. see above see above"
667,"I was able to get rid of a nasty sinus infection that had been bothering me for over a week I suddenly developed a rash across my stomach and itched for at least one - two hours after each dose. The doctor would prescribe Erythromycin for me every time I developed a sinus infection. (This had been going on since childhood). I would take a regimen of 4 tablets daily for a total of 7 days. I was also given Sudafed to help with the allergies I suffered from. Occassionally I was also given a saline solution to flush out my sinuses. The last time I was given this regimen however, I had an allergic reaction and began itching. I broke out in a rash within 45min. of taking the first dose. The doctor told us to ""keep an eye on it and if I had difficulty breathing or any other symptoms I was to rush to the ER."" Other wise he felt the symptoms to be within normal limits. I continued the regimen and was able to get rid of the infection but was given a different antibiotic the next time I got an infection."
